            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce there are few (if any) <hi>Readers,</hi> who are not deſirous to be either <hi>diverted</hi> or <hi>inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> the <hi>Tranſlator</hi> preſumes that he may ſpare himſelf the Trouble of Recommending a <hi>Book</hi> which is ſo admirably well fitted to <hi>both</hi> theſe Deſigns, and will infallibly ſatisfie thoſe who expect either <hi>Pleaſure</hi> or <hi>Advantage</hi> by peruſing it.</p>
            <p>'Tis generally ſuppos'd to be written by the <hi>Abbot VERTAT;</hi> whoſe former Performances in this kind were receiv'd abroad with the unanimous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that ſuch Prejudices as theſe are ſo far from being <hi>Groundleſs Suſpicions,</hi> that they are the natural Conſequences of a prudent Caution. But ſince it wou'd be equally unjuſt and inhumane to condemn a Man for the Fault of another, our <hi>Author</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62547:5"/>may reaſonably deſire his <hi>Readers</hi> to ſuſpend their Judgment till they have examin'd his <hi>Book,</hi> which is the beſt <hi>Apology</hi> that can be made for him: For they will ſoon find a more than ſufficient Number of convincing Proofs of his Innocence and Integrity, and be oblig'd to acknowledge that his Exactneſs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality are as conſpicuous as the Clearneſs and Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of his Judgment. He penetrates into the deepeſt Myſteries of <hi>State,</hi> and diſcovers the hidden <hi>Springs</hi> that put all the <hi>Wheels</hi> in motion. He omits nothing that may ſerve to illuſtrate or embelliſh his Subject; and never inſerts any thing that is either impertinent, or beneath the regard of a <hi>Hiſtorian.</hi> His <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters</hi> are juſt and lively, his <hi>Digreſſions</hi> few and uſeful, and he is every where conſiſtent with himſelf. He repreſents <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ugly Form; and expoſes the Avarice and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> with as much Freedom as he cenſures <hi>Luther</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. Such <hi>Plain-dealing</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity</hi> may be look'd upon as Prodigies, in a Book that is printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> dedicated to the <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and written by a <hi>French Abbot.</hi> And ſuch rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Qualities may, in ſome meaſure, atone for the Harſhneſs and Severity of his <hi>Reflexions</hi> upon the <hi>Firſt Reformers;</hi> and will certainly oblige all mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Perſons to pardon an Errour that muſt be reckon'd among the <hi>Prejudices</hi> of <hi>Education,</hi> and perhaps was only intended as a <hi>Blind</hi> to cover him from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Since no Man can be ſuppos'd to be capable of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the late memorable Tranſactions in <hi>this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> 'twou'd be a ridiculous piece of Nicety to diſpute the Truth of even the oddeſt and moſt improbable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of K. <hi>Chriſtiern</hi>'s <hi>Flight</hi> and <hi>Abdication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Story of the <hi>Maſſacre</hi> of <hi>Stockholm</hi> will not be condemn'd as a Fable; nor the unmanly Barbarity of that <hi>Prince,</hi> in murthering a whole <hi>Parliament,</hi> be reckon'd too black a Crime to be faſten'd upon a <hi>Crown'd Head,</hi> at a time when we have reaſon to believe that there are ſome <hi>Princes</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> who ſcruple not to conſent to, and even encourage the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſination</hi> of a <hi>Sovereign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Man who is acquainted with the <hi>Amours</hi> of a <hi>Monarch</hi> who makes at preſent a very great Figure in the World, will be ſurpriz'd at the Character of

               <hi>Sigebrite,</hi> and the <hi>Extravagant Paſſion</hi> of her <hi>Unfortunate Lover.</hi>

            <p>AMong the moſt Entertaining Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that Hiſtory may afford us, I know none that deſerve more At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, than ſuch Changes as States are ſubject to, with reſpect to Religion and Government. Every Man finds himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd on the Account of what is moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of moving his Affections, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and his Ambition: Each Character is animated with lively Paſſions; All is in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The People deſigning to re-aſſume that which they think to be their Primitive Right, and moſt ancient Privileges, will chuſe their own Maſter, and determine their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: They ſide with thoſe, in whoſe Favour Prejudice and Paſſion ſway 'em; while the Grandees themſelves are forc'd to fawn upon the Mob, that they may by their Aſſiſtance advance their own Intereſts, and private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
            <p>When the Hiſtorian is a good Painter, he preſents a moſt curious Draught to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's View: And if he be alſo a good Judge, he makes that uſeful and profitable, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was pleaſant; by ſhewing, on one hand, the Inconveniencies that attend thoſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
<pb facs="tcp:62547:7"/>Revolutions; and on the other, by giving us a faithful Deſcription of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter who appear on the Scene, and doing thoſe famous Men all the Juſtice they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
            <p>Here are repreſented a Nobility factious within it ſelf, almoſt independent from their Sovereign, above all, jealous of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which the Biſhop's aſſumd, and envious of their exceſſive Revenues. The Prelates uſurping their Prince's Rights; and often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning the Sanctity of their Character, by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Violence. A whole Kingdom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between theſe two Parties; and the <hi>Danes</hi> turning their Neighbours Troubles to their own Profit and Advantage, declaring for one of 'em, and at length falling upon both. A Maſſacre of the Senate and Nobility: And, in a Word, the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Monarchy ſhaken in its very Foundation, deſtitute of its King, Senate, Generals and Armies; and ready to become an unhappy Province of <hi>Denmark.</hi> When a Prince comes on the Stage, famous for his many Exploits, and the Head of that Branch which now ſits on the Throne; whoſe Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Conduct expels the <hi>Danes</hi> out of his Country, and whoſe Policy does by degrees gain him all that Authority which the Clergy and Nobility had uſurp'd on his Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>Here thoſe Riches, which, in the former Ages of the Church, were the Marks of the Prince's Bounty, and the Reward of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy's Holineſs and Vertue, are ſeen to become
<pb facs="tcp:62547:7"/>the Occaſion of thoſe Diſorders; which was the Cauſe and Pretence of their being utterly depriv'd of theſe Advantages.</p>
            <p>Here an Elective Crown is made Succeſſive and Hereditary, by the Valour of a Prince, who, from an unhappy Exile, becomes King; and ſo Abſolute, as to change the Form of the Government, as his Inclination and Intereſt directed him.</p>
            <p>I own, I was offended at the little Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sincerity many Authors wrote with, in relation to the Affairs with <hi>Sweden:</hi> Some have diſguis'd the Truth of Things; and others have not been curious enough in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming us of the moſt remarkable Paſſages, and the Motives of thoſe Enterprizes. But the more theſe Authors ſeem'd to contradict one another, the more Care I took to reconcile 'em; and to diſtinguiſh what was true from what was falſe, I perus'd with greater Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation all the Hiſtorians who treat of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, whether

               <hi>Swedes, Danes, German</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> Catholicks or Proteſtants: I read 'em free from all other Intereſt or Paſſion, than that of knowing the Truth, and writing it with Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And I have reaſon to hope I ſhall not be accus'd of being byaſs'd by any Party; a Fault too mean to be committed by a ſincere and impartial Hiſtorian.</p>

            <p>I have not prais'd the Heads of the <hi>Roman</hi> Party in all they did, becauſe all their Actions were not laudable: They always had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of defending a Party which had the Truth on its ſide; but they themſelves very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten were contented with an outward Zeal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an inward Faith; and were leſs eager in the Defence of their Religion, than in that of the Wealth it procured 'em.</p>
            <p>Neither have I wholly blam'd nor deſpi'sd the Heads of the Proteſtant Faction, becauſe they were not wholly to be blam'd, or deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: I have diſtinguiſh'd Errour from Malice; and reſpected the great Parts, and excellent Qualifications which God, as the Author of Nature, had endow'd ſuch Perſons with, as he had not led by his Grace into the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his true Religion.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF THE <hi>Revolutions</hi> IN SWEDEN.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SWEDEN</hi> was anciently an <hi>Elective Kingdom,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1350"/> and was ſtill ſuch about the middle of the <hi>Fourteenth Age;</hi> for tho' the Children and neareſt Relations of the Deceas'd Monarch were uſually advanc'd to the Throne, the Order of <hi>Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> was ſometimes neglected, and the Succeſſion was always determin'd by <hi>Choice.</hi> And by virtue of this Right of <hi>Election,</hi> the <hi>Swedes</hi> oftentimes claim'd a Power to <hi>Depoſe</hi> their Sovereigns, when they incroach'd upon the Liberty and Privileges of the Nation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Royal Authority</hi> was confin'd within very narrow Limits; for the King cou'd neither make War nor Peace, and much leſs raiſe Money or Soldiers without the Conſent of the <hi>Senate,</hi> or of the <hi>Eſtates</hi> when they were aſſembl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d: 'Twas not lawful for him to erect new Forts, or to put
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62547:20"/>the Government of the old Caſtles into the Hands of Strangers.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1282"/> The bringing of Forreign Troops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom, wou'd have infallibly expos'd him to the Danger of an Univerſal Revolt: For every thing that might ſerve to extend, or even to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> was hated and ſuſpected by the <hi>People,</hi> who were as jealous of the Power of their <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> as of that of their <hi>Neighbours</hi> and <hi>Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Patrimonial Revenue</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> conſiſted only in certain ſmall Territories near <hi>Upſal,</hi> and in a very eaſie Tribute which was exacted from the Peaſants by way of a <hi>Poll-Tax.</hi> In the Reign of King <hi>Magnus Ladaſlaſz,</hi> the Copper Mines, the Propriety of the three great Lakes <hi>Meler, Vener,</hi> and <hi>Veter,</hi> and the Right of Fiſhing upon the Coaſt of the Baltick Sea, were by the Senate reunited to the Crown; and by the ſame Authority it was ordain'd, That they who had purchas'd untill'd Lands held in Fee, or a Right to Paſturage in the Foreſts, ſhould afterwards pay thoſe Duties to the Crown, from which they had freed themſelves during the Civil Wars. Since by the Laws of the Kingdom, there were few Offences puniſhable with Death, the Fines and Forfeitures that were exacted on ſuch Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, were of old a conſiderable Branch of the King's Revenue; but the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> had ſeiz'd on the Profits which accru'd that way, and perhaps colour'd their Injuſtice under a Pretext that theſe Fines belong'd to the Church, as a kind of Expiation or Atonement for the Crimes of the Malefactors.</p>
               <p>The Fees or Mannors, and the Governments of Caſtles, which at firſt were only granted for Life, or for a Term of Years, were inſenſibly chang'd to Hereditary Poſſeſſions: For the <hi>Noble-men</hi> who enjoy'd 'em, neglected the Payment of the uſual Daties for thoſe Poſts which they held by no other
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62547:20"/>Title but their own Power, and the Weakneſs of the Crown. And the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and others of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who were poſſeſt of ſuch Places, made uſe of the plauſible Pretext of <hi>Religion,</hi> to claim an Exemption from the Duties they were oblig'd to pay for thoſe Eſtates which they pretended were devolv'd to the Church, and become part of its Patrimony. Thus the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Nobility</hi> had, by ſeveral Uſurpations, engroſs'd ſo great a part of the <hi>Prince's Revenue,</hi> that the Remainder at that time was ſcarce ſufficient to maintain 500 Horſe. The <hi>King</hi> was almoſt only conſider'd as the <hi>Captain-General</hi> of the State during the <hi>War,</hi> and as the <hi>Preſident of the Senate</hi> in time of <hi>Peace:</hi> 'Tis true, the former of theſe Junctures was always moſt favourable to the Prerogative, eſpecially when the War was carry'd on with Succeſs againſt the Enemies of the Nation; but the Concluſion of a Peace put a ſtop to his growing Authority, and left him only a Power to call a Meeting of the Eſtates, to propoſe Matter for their Deliberation, and to execute their Decrees.</p>
               <p>The Public Authority was almoſt entirely lodg'd in the <hi>Senate,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1350"/> which was uſually compos'd of <hi>Twelve Lords,</hi> who for the moſt part were Governors of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, or Principal Officers of State. Theſe Lords attended the King at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> the Capital City of the Kingdom, when any Important Affairs were to be tranſacted. The <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Upſal,</hi> Primate of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lincepinc, Seregnez, Veſteras, Seara, Abeo,</hi> and <hi>Vexio.</hi>
                  </note> was a Senator by his Office; and the <hi>ſix Biſhops</hi> of the Kingdom bore a great Sway in the Meeting of the <hi>Eſtates,</hi> tho' they had no right to ſit in the <hi>Senate,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they were nominated by the King, or choſen by the Eſtates during an <hi>Interregnum.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1282"/> The Dignity of a Senator was not Hereditary, for the Nomination of thoſe Officers was a Branch of the Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and ſome of the Biſhops, or principal Lords of the Kingdom, were choſen by the King to ſupply the vacant Places, who by this means had a fair Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62547:21"/>to introduce his Friends and Creatures into the Senate. But he was frequently diſappointed in his Choice, and for the moſt part loſt a Friend when he made him a Senator: For the nearer a Favorite was advanc'd to his Maſter's Power and Authority, he was the farther remov'd from his Intereſt. And beſides the Love of Liberty and Affection to their Country, were in thoſe days the predominant Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>Swedes;</hi> nor could any Engagement or Obligation weaken the Biaſs of ſo powerful an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> which at firſt was only inſtituted as a <hi>Council</hi> to adviſe the King, had by degrees aſſum'd an Authority over his Actions. The eldeſt Senator pretended a Right to admoniſh and check the Prince, when he tranſgreſs'd the Limits of his Prerogative. The People look'd upon the Senators as the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Liberty and Privileges of the Nation. The Sovereign Power and Majeſty of the State was properly lodg'd in that Body. There Juſtice was adminiſter'd Independently and without Appeal, and both War and Peace depended on their Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 'Tis true they acted joyntly with the King, but he was oftentimes oblig'd to content himſelf with the Honour of executing their Reſolutions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Clergy</hi> were poſteſt of greater Riches than the King and all the other Eſtates of the Kingdom. The <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Upſal</hi> and his ſix <hi>Suffragans,</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd their Dignity with all the Splendor that a vaſt Treaſure cou'd enable 'em to diſplay. They were for the moſt part the Temporal Lords of their Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Sees: And beſides the Poſſeſſions that were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to their Biſhopricks, which conſiſted in ſeveral conſiderable <hi>Signiories</hi> or Lordſhips, they had made themſelves Heirs to all the Eccleſiaſticks that died Inteſtate in their reſpective Dioceſſes, which by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees had extreamly augmented their Revenues. They enjoy'd the Proſits of Fines and Forfeitures which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62547:21"/>formerly belong'd to the Crown, and by ſeveral Foundations and Pious Legacies, had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of a conſiderable number of the King's Mannors and Fees. The Patrimony of the Church was daily augmented by Donations, but cou'd never be diminiſh'd by Sale or Alienation, for ſuch Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes were forbidden by expreſs Laws; which were as prejudicial to the <hi>Laity,</hi> as advantageous to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and ſerv'd only to eſtabliſh the Grandeur of the latter, upon the Ruins of the former.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Biſhops</hi> made ſo good Uſe of the Influence they had over the People at Elections, and of the Need a Pretender had of their Votes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that they obtain'd on ſuch Occaſions ſeveral Privileges, which did very conſiderably diminiſh both the Revenue and Authority of the Prince. They exacted what Conditions they pleas'd of the King, before they wou'd own him to be their Sovereign: And before they wou'd perform the Ceremony of his Coronation, they oblig'd him to Swear, That he wou'd inviolably preſerve 'em in the Poſſeſſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> their Rights and Privileges; That he wou'd never attempt to put a Garriſon into any of their Caſtles or Forts; That the Lands and Mannors which they enjoy'd, by what Means ſoever they had come to the Poſſeſſion of 'em, ſhou'd not be re-united to the Crown; and at the ſame time they made him Sign a Paper, declaring that he conſented to his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, if ever he ſhou'd violate his Oath by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon their Privileges.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Prelates</hi> grew ſo proud of their Riches, and of the number of their Vaſſals, that they began by degrees, to act like ſo many little Sovereigns. They fortify'd their Caſtles, and kept Garriſons in 'em: They never appear'd without a numerous Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Gentlemen and Soldiers, and were ſtill at the Head of all Factions and Intrigues.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62547:22"/>Differences relating to their Vaſſals, or about the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of their Eſtates; and even ſometimes ſcrupl'd not to march at the Head of an Army againſt their Sovereign, eſpecially when they ſuſpected him of a Deſign to recover the Duties and Lands that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Crown.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> fortify'd their Caſtles, and made 'em the Seats of their petty Empires. They treated their Vaſſals like menial Servants, tho' they allow'd 'em no Wages; they made 'em Till their Lands, and oftentimes put 'em in Arms to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions into the Territories of their Neighbours. The <hi>Swediſh Nobility</hi> was not then diſtinguiſh'd by the Titles of <hi>Baron, Count,</hi> or <hi>Marqueſs,</hi> or by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Names of Families: They were only known by the reſpective <hi>Arms</hi> of their Houſes, and by their Fathers Name,

                  </note> which they bore joyntly with their own; and were noted only for their Valour, and for the numerous Train of Vaſſals that follow'd 'em to the War. They defended their Rights, and reveng'd the Injuries they receiv'd, by Force of Arms, and neither ſought nor expected Redreſs from the publick Juſtice, becauſe there was no Power in the Government to put the Laws in Execution. <hi>Force</hi> was the Standard of Law and Juſtice, and the Supream Decider of all ſorts of Controverſies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Burghers</hi> of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> and the Inhabitants of other <hi>Maritime</hi> Towns, who ſubſiſted merely by Trading, were more ſubmiſſive to the King, and better affected to the Government.

Thoſe who liv'd in fertile Countries apply'd themſelves to <hi>Husbandry;</hi> but in <hi>Helfingland, Cueſtricland, Angerme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other Northern Provinces, they ſpent their time in <hi>Hunting</hi> Fallow.

They were mere Savages, for the moſt part bred in Woods, jealous of their Cuſtoms, and having little to loſe, were ready upon the leaſt Occaſion to riſe up in Arms and revolt againſt the Government. <hi>Idolatry</hi> was ſtill openly profeſs'd in ſome of their Villages, and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> prevail'd in others; but their Religion was ſo disfigur'd by a Mixture of their Ancient Superſtitions, that they ſcarce retain'd more of it than the bare Name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Peaſants</hi> were the moſt numerous and potent Body of the State: Some of 'em held immediately of the Crown, and ſent Deputies to the <hi>Diets;</hi> and the reſt were Vaſſals to the Clergy and Nobility. Tho' the Tribute they paid to the King was very eaſy and inconſiderable, he was oftentimes oblig'd to levy it by Force, and to ſend ſome regulated Troops to the Forreſts and Mountains, for the Security of thoſe who were appointed to collect his Duties. They ſeldom or never contributed their Aſſiſtance to the Preſervation of the State, but in the Quality of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; and even in that Caſe they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves oblig'd only to defend the Frontiers of their reſpective Provinces, and always claim'd the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of chuſing their own Leaders.</p>
               <p>In all other Reſpects they liv'd almoſt without any Dependence upon the Court, and ev'n without any Union or Concord among themſelves; being equally

               <p>If we reflect upon the Independency of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the limited Authority of the Sovereign, and the different Intereſts of the ſeveral Orders that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the State, 'twill not appear Strange, that the Kingdom was almoſt perpetually haraſs'd with Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and Civil Wars. Moſt of the Kings aſpir'd at a more abſolute Authority, and ſome of 'em by the Aſſiſtance of their Friends and Creatures, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to make themſelves Maſters of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ſhake off their Dependence on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: But the People were ſo far from being uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd Spectators of an open Violation of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Privileges of the Nation, that the very Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and leaſt Appearance of <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd an univerſal Revolt, and re-united all the States againſt the King.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Biſhops</hi> were afraid of Reprizals under too powerful a Prince, who might ſeize upon his alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Revenues, and perhaps confine the Clergy within the Limits of their Profeſſion: The <hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> took up Arms to defend the Privileges that made 'em in a manner Independent; and the <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants,</hi> without comprehending their true Intereſt, fought with the utmoſt Vigor and Obſtinacy for the Preſervation of certain Cuſtoms that were uſeleſs to the Public, but agreeable to their Savage Temper. The whole Kingdom was a perpetual Scene of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Deſolations, and Revolts: The Fate of the King ſeem'd to be in the Hands of his Subjects, and to depend on their Capricious Humour; and ſeveral Princes were driven out of the Kingdom, for attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make themſelves <hi>Abſolute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Jealouſy that reign'd among the principal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Kingdom, made 'em willing to retain the Title and Dignity of a <hi>King:</hi> But at the ſame
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62547:23"/>Time they reſolv'd to beſtow that Honour only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Foreign Prince, that having no private Eſtate in the Kingdom, and being wholly deſtitute of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Creatures, they might oblige him to content himſelf with as much Authority as they thought fit to allow him.</p>
               <p>About the year 1363. <hi>Magnus Smock,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1363"/> reign'd in <hi>Sweden:</hi> he had two Sons, <hi>Eric</hi> and <hi>Haquin,</hi> by his Wife <hi>Blanch,</hi> Daughter to the Count of <hi>Namur.</hi> The Elder of theſe Princes being dead, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Norway</hi> beſtow'd the Crown of that Kingdom upon the Younger, who by his Father's Advice had marry'd <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter to <hi>Valdemar</hi> IV. King of <hi>Denmark. Magnus</hi> having ſecur'd <hi>Norway,</hi> and being ſupported by his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Aliance, wou'd not let ſlip ſo favourable an Opportunity to make himſelf abſolute in <hi>Sweden,</hi> by aboliſhing the Senate of that Kingdom: And perhaps that Project was concerted by all the Three Kings, and deſign'd to be put in Execution in their reſpective Kingdoms, to rid themſelves of that dreaded Aſſembly which check'd their growing Authority and controul'd all their ambitious Deſigns. But as ſoon as the <hi>Swedes</hi> diſcover'd the Intentions and Correſpondence of theſe three Princes, they took up Arms immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and <hi>Sweden</hi> became the Theatre of a cruel and bloody War. <hi>Valdemar,</hi> during his Life, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diligent in aſſiſting his Ally; and <hi>Haquin</hi> ſent a conſiderable Body of Men to re-inforce his Father's Army: But the <hi>Swedes</hi> alone, who were always ſtrong enough when they fought for the Defence of their Liberty,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1365"/> routed the Joynt-Forces of theſe three Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, and at laſt drove <hi>Magnus</hi> out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, eſteeming themſelves ſufficiently rewarded for all the Blood they had ſpent in the Cauſe, by the Liberty they had to chuſe a new Sovereign. They proceeded immediately to an Election, and the Choice fell upon Prince <hi>Albert,</hi> ſecond Son to the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62547:24"/>Duke of <hi>Meckelburgh,</hi> and Nephew to the late King <hi>Magnus,</hi> excluding King <hi>Haquin,</hi> and <hi>Henry, Albert</hi>'s Elder Brother, whom they hated and ſuſpected, as perſons who had always promoted the Intereſt of the Prince whom they had lately dethron'd.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Albert</hi> ow'd his Advancement to the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Humour of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> which cou'd not bear the Yoke of too abſolute a power. Before his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Crown, that he might promote his own Intereſt he ſeem'd to embrace that of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but as ſoon as he found himſelf fix'd upon the Throne, he began to follow the Maxims of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, and ſtudy'd the moſt promiſing Methods by which he might make himſelf the abſolute Maſter of his Subjects.</p>
               <p>The Senate was the object both of his Jealouſy, and Averſion; but the Fate of King <hi>Magnus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd him from attempting to aboliſh that powerful Body, much leſs cou'd he hope either to gain or over-aw thoſe rich and potent Lords that look'd upon themſelves rather as his <hi>Tutors</hi> than <hi>Councellors.</hi> And therefore to ballance their Authority, he ſent for ſome Princes of his Family, and ſeveral <hi>German</hi> Lords and Captains, whom he intruſted with the Command of the Troops and principal Forts of the Kingdom. He introduc'd ſome of theſe Strangers, into the Senate, againſt the fundamental Laws of the State; and under various pretexts brought into <hi>Sweden</hi> a conſiderable Number of Foreign Troops, who began to render him terrible to his own Subjects. Then he proceeded to impoſe exorbitant Taxes upon the People for the payment of his Army: But this politic Contrivance to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his Authority being puſh'd on too far, ſerv'd only to haſten his Deſtruction; for the <hi>Swedes</hi> grew jealous of their Privileges, and reſolv'd to ſhake off that rigorous Yoke which they were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to bear.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:62547:24"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Margaret</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Valdemar</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and Widow of <hi>Haquin</hi> King of <hi>Norwey,</hi> was at the ſame time poſſeſs'd of the Crowns of both theſe Kingdoms. For after the Death of the King her Husband, who did not long Survive the Defeat and ABDICATION of his Father King <hi>Magnus,</hi> the States of <hi>Norwey</hi> intruſted her with the Regency of the Kingdom, and the Guardianſhip of her Son <hi>Olaus.</hi> And during her Adminiſtration of the Government ſhe made ſo good Uſe of her Time, and manag'd her deſigns with ſo much Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and Succeſs, that when the young Prince dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Norwegians</hi> found they were not at liberty to proceed to a new Choice.</p>
               <p>She was Miſtreſs of the Army,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1374"/> and of the Forts or places of Strength; ſo that the Principal Lords of the Kingdom, who were not gain'd to her party, durſt not ſeem diſſatisfi'd nor ſo much as indifferent at a Time when they cou'd not without Danger diſcover their true Sentiments. Thus <hi>Margaret</hi> was elected by the Eſtates, and exchang'd the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a <hi>Regent</hi> for that of a <hi>Sovereign Queen,</hi> having already born the ſame Title as the Wife of King <hi>Haquin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Valdemar</hi> her Father dying the ſame Year, without leaving any Prince of his Blood whom the <hi>Danes</hi> might chuſe for his Succeſſor, ſhe ſent Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the States General of the Kingdom to Solicite her Election to that Crown. <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Mackelburgh,</hi> the Elder brother of <hi>Albert</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and Husband of her Elder Siſter the Princeſs <hi>Ingelburge,</hi> employ'd his intereſt to obtain the ſame Dignity; and flattering himſelf with the advantage he had of being a Son-in-Law to the deceas'd, King thought he might eaſily contend with a Female Competitor: But the Queen's Agents drew ſuch convincing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from the <hi>Merit,</hi> and perhaps alſo from the <hi>Money</hi> of their Miſtreſs, that ſhe was unanimouſly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62547:25"/>elected by the whole Aſſembly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1375"/> and proclam'd Queen of <hi>Denmark</hi> in the Meeting of the Eſtates. As ſoon as ſhe receiv'd the News of her Advancement, ſhe left <hi>Norwey,</hi> and went immediately to <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen,</hi> where ſhe fixt the Seat of her Empire.</p>
               <p>This Princeſs, who by ſome is call'd the <hi>Semira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis of the North,</hi> beſides the uſual Ambition of her Sex, was Miſtreſs of a Dexterity in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Affairs, and of a Capacity to form a long Series of coherent Projects, that are rarely obſerv'd in a Woman. Her Inclinations to Love were ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her Character and Dignity, that is, ſhe was not really in love with any thing but Glory, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of any Paſſion but her Ambition to extend the limits of her Empire, and advance her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>She rejoyc'd in ſecret at the Diſſatisfaction of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and endeavour'd to gain ſome of the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men of that Nation. She beſtow'd Penſions and an honourable Entertainment on thoſe that were ill treated by King <hi>Albert;</hi> and openly blam'd his injuſtice in violating the Liberty and Privileges of his Subjects. That Prince was daily laying new Impoſitions upon his People, without the conſent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Eſtates or Senat, and had already Squeez'd conſiderable Sums out of the Clergy by way of Loans: But nothing render'd him more odious both to the Biſhops and Nobility, than his Reuniting to the Crown the third part of thoſe Fees or Eſtates to which the Clergy and Gentry claim'd a right by vertue of ſo long a Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>This was the fatal ſignal of an univerſal Revolt; the <hi>Swedes</hi> conſpir'd unanimouſly againſt him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to drive him out of the Kingdom, and to offer the Crown to Queen <hi>Margaret.</hi> They ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that ſhe had already ſo much buſineſs in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> that ſhe wou'd content her ſelf with almoſt the bare Title of <hi>Queen of Sweden:</hi> And tho' ſhe ſhou'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62547:25"/>endeavour to ſtretch the Prerogative too far, they concluded that the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norwegians</hi> wou'd unite all their Forces to keep their common Soveraign in a dependence on the Eſtates and Senate of each King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>In purſuance of this Deſign, they ſecretly depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome of the moſt conſiderable Lords of the Kingdom to offer her the Crown, and ſhe receiv'd the Propoſal with joy, as the moſt probable means to ſecure the Peace of <hi>Denmark.</hi> For the violent Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity that reign'd betwixt the Subjects of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was of as ancient a date as the Foundation of the two Kingdoms; and that Antipathy, which is uſually obſerv'd betwixt Neighbouring States, had all along been a perpetual ſource of War, which had oftentimes prov'd fatal to <hi>Denmark.</hi> And beſides this prudent Princeſs concluded, that her new Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement might one day furniſh her with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to unite <hi>Sweden</hi> to <hi>Denmark.</hi> Theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations made her reſolve to give a favourable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Propoſals of the Male contents: She agreed with their Deputies that the Nobility ſhou'd riſe up in Arms, that they ſhou'd acquaint King <hi>Albert</hi> with his Depoſition, that the Army and Eſtates ſhou'd publickly acknowledge her to be their Soveraign, and that after her Election ſhe ſhou'd be oblig'd to ſend a conſiderable Body of Troops to ſupport and defend 'em.</p>
               <p>The Treaty being ſign'd,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1385"/> the <hi>Swedes</hi> immediately took up arms againſt the King, and ſent a Herald to intimate and declare that they renounc'd the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance they had ſworn to him. At the ſame time they proclaim'd <hi>Margaret de Valdemar,</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and aſſoon as they had receiv'd the Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement which they expected from that Princeſs, the united Armies march'd towards <hi>Weſt-Gothland,</hi> where King <hi>Albert</hi> was drawing his Forces together to oppoſe 'em. That Prince had taken all poſſible
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62547:26"/>care to put himſelf in a poſture of defence: he had rais'd a conſiderable Body of Troops, obtain'd the Aſſiſtance of ſeveral <hi>German</hi> Princes who were either his Relations or Allies, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd the Iſle of <hi>Gothland</hi> for the payment of twenty Thouſand <hi>Roſe-Nobles</hi> of the Coin of <hi>England,</hi> which he borrow'd of the Knights of the <hi>Teutonick Order</hi> to maintain the Charge of the War. But all theſe preparations could not divert his impending Fate: The two Armies met near <hi>Falcopinc,</hi> and <hi>Albert</hi> was not only defeated, but had the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to fall into the Hands of his Enemies, with his Son Prince <hi>Eric,</hi> and the principal Lords of his Party.</p>
               <p>The Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Meckelburgh,</hi> and <hi>Gerard</hi> Count of <hi>Holſtein</hi> endeavour'd to revive the drooping Hopes of this unfortunate Prince. They levy'd new Troops, and obtain'd conſiderable Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours from the <hi>Hans-Towns</hi> who were jealous of the Queen's Power, and dreaded the ſucceſsful progreſs of her Arms. Thus <hi>Sweden</hi> was made a prey to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral different and Jarring Nations, who ſeem'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to agree in a Deſign to ruin that Kingdom; and amid'ſt ſo many Diſaſters, the poor Inhabitants cou'd not diſtinguiſh their Friends from their Enemies. The War laſted almoſt ſeven Years with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Fury, and a vaſt expence of Blood: And the Peace that ſucceeded was rather an effect of the Wearineſs of the two contending Parties,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1392"/> than of any Abatement of the Rage that animated 'em. <hi>Albert</hi> was at laſt conſtrain'd to exchange his <hi>Crown</hi> for his <hi>Liberty,</hi> and retir'd to his Native Country; after which Queen <hi>Margaret</hi>'s Title to the Crowns of the Three Kingdoms of the North was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally own'd and acknowledg'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> ſeeing themſelves ſubject to a Princeſs that had no Children, and fearing that after her Death King <hi>Albert</hi> or the Prince his Son might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62547:26"/>their pretenſions to the Crown, intreated her to ſecure the happineſs of the Kingdom by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Match. This Propoſal, however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, was not at all welcome to the Queen: She was too fond of the Sovereign Power to ſhare it with a Husband: Yet that ſhe might not ſeem to ſlight the Petition of her new Subjects, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to appoint her Succeſſor. But at the ſame Time ſhe reſolv'd to chuſe a Prince whoſe tender Age might ſecure the quiet of her Government, and keep him from attempting to mount the Throne during her Life. In purſuance of this Reſolution ſhe ſent for Prince <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Pomerania</hi> the Son of <hi>Wartiſlas</hi> VII, and of <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Meckelburgh,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Meckelburgh</hi> and of <hi>Ingelburge</hi> the Queen's Elder Siſter. She order'd him to be call'd <hi>Eric,</hi> a Name which Twelve Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> had already born, reſolving to educate him at her Court, and to make him the Heir of the Three Northern Crowns.</p>
               <p>The Form of Government in theſe Kingdoms was almoſt the ſame: All three were <hi>Elective,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation had its <hi>Senate,</hi> without whoſe advice, or the conſent of the <hi>Eſtates,</hi> the Prince cou'd not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any important Affair. In order to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of her great Deſign, the Queen ſpent ſome time in gaining Creatures, and ſecuring the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of ſome of the Leading Men of each Nation. And aſſoon as ſhe found her Project ripe for Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, ſhe call'd a Meeting or <hi>Convention</hi> of the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of her Three Kingdoms to be held at <hi>Calmar</hi> in <hi>Sweden,</hi> whither Forty Deputies of each Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on repair'd to eſtabliſh a Fundamental Law, for the uniting of the Three Kingdoms under one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</p>
               <p>The Queen preſented the young Duke of <hi>Pomerania</hi> to the <hi>Convention,</hi> and entreated 'em to confirm her Choice. She endeavour'd with a great
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62547:27"/>deal of Eloquence to make 'em ſenſible of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages they might expect by obeying the ſame Sovereign; and put 'em in mind of the happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of her Election, which had eſtabliſh'd the public Tranquillity, and compos'd all thoſe fatal Animoſities that are wont to diſturb the quiet of Neighbouring States. She repreſented to 'em the inviting proſpect they had of making themſelves Maſters of all the Trade of the <hi>Baltic</hi> Sea, and that the <hi>Hanſe-Towns</hi> cou'd never afterwards enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their Diviſions: adding that the only way to perpetuate theſe advantages, and to make the Union ſolid and durable, was to unite the Three Kingdoms into one Monarchy, by a ſolemn and Fundamental Law.</p>
               <p>The Preſence of ſo great a Princeſs,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1395"/> the ſolidity of her Arguments, the Applauſes and Intereſt of her Creatures, either gain'd or commanded the Conſent of all the Deputies. The Election of the Duke of <hi>Pomerania</hi> was unanimouſly approv'd, and the Three Kingdoms of the North were united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Prince and his Succeſſors, by a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law, which was receiv'd by the Three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and confirm'd by the moſt ſolemn Oaths.</p>
               <p>This Celebrated <hi>Union of Calmar</hi> inſtead of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a laſting Concord betwixt the Northern Kingdoms, was the fatal occaſion of thoſe bloody Wars that kept <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> in a perpetual Flame for above a hundred Years. It conſiſted of <hi>Three</hi> Main <hi>Articles,</hi> which ſeem'd to have been fram'd on purpoſe to ſecure the liberty and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of each Nation. By the <hi>Firſt</hi> 'twas or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd that theſe three Kingdoms which by the conſtitution of their Government were <hi>Elective</hi> ſhou'd afterwards be Subject to one King, who ſhou'd be elected by turns in each Kingdom; and that the Royal Dignity ſhou'd not be appropriated to any one Nation to the prejudice or Excluſion of the reſt,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62547:27"/>unleſs the deceaſt Prince ſhou'd leave Children or Relations, whom the <hi>Convention</hi> of the three <hi>Eſtates</hi> ſhou'd judge worthy to ſucceed him. The <hi>Second</hi> oblig'd the Soveraign to ſhare his Preſence betwixt the three <hi>Realms,</hi> and to ſpend the Revenue of each Crown in the reſpective Kingdom, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the Money he receiv'd, or applying it to any other uſe than the particular advantage and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Kingdom where 'twas levy'd. And by the <hi>Third</hi> and moſt important Article 'twas provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that each Kingdom ſhou'd retain its Senate, Laws, Cuſtoms, and Privileges; that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, Magiſtrates, Generals, Biſhops, Soldiers and Garriſons ſhou'd be Natives of the Kingdom where they were employ'd; and that the King ſhou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſpoſe of any of theſe Poſts to Foreigners, or to the Subjects of his other Kingdoms who ſhou'd be reputed Foreigners and <hi>Aliens</hi> to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Countrey where they were not born.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> were extremely pleas'd to think that the Royal Prerogative was ſo effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd by this Treaty, that the Soveraign cou'd never afterwards invade the liberties of the Subject. But they were ſoon convinc'd of their Error, and both ſaw and felt the fatal Conſequences of their miſtaken Policy. The Queen was too Powerful and Ambitious to content her ſelf with ſo limited an Authority. She was ſcarce ſettl'd upon the Throne of <hi>Sweden;</hi> when ſhe began to extend her Power, and endeavour'd with an extraordinary Application to make her ſelf the Abſolute Miſtreſs of the Kingdom. She ſeiz'd on all the Principal Forts, which ſhe cunningly got out of the Hands of the Gentry by propoſing ſome tempting Exchange that might enrich their Families, but leſſen their Power and augment their Dependance on the Court. She beſtow'd moſt of the Vacant Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62547:28"/>on <hi>Daniſh</hi> Lords, againſt the Proviſo expreſly mention'd in the Treaty of <hi>Calmar,</hi> and by degrees remov'd the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Nobility from all the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Places of Honour and Truſt in the Kingdom. <hi>Abraham Broderſon</hi> a young <hi>Swediſh</hi> Lord, who had a very graceful Mien and was admirably well ſhap'd had the peculiar honour of her Favor: She gave him the Government of <hi>Haland</hi> and made him her only Confident. But her extraordinary kindneſs to a Man whoſe <hi>Handſomeneſs</hi> was his only <hi>Merit,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of obliging the reſt of his Countrimen, furniſh'd the diſaffected party with a new pretext to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure her Behaviour, and murmur againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. At laſt they adventur'd to expreſs their diſſatisfaction to the Queen her ſelf: They went in a Body to attend her, and laid before her the Titles by which they held their Priviledges, and a Copy of the Treaty of <hi>Calmar,</hi> the Violation of which gaul'd 'em extreamly. But that cunning and imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princeſs was too well acquainted with her own Power to dread the Effects of their Impotent Rage: and inſtead of returning a Satisfactory Anſwer to their Addreſs, ſhe told 'em in a ſlighting and diſdainful Manner, That ſhe wou'd adviſe 'em to <hi>keep their Charters and Titles as carefully as ſhe intended to keep the Forts of the Kingdom.</hi> She govern'd ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with an abſolute Power, and endeavour'd to ſecure and confirm her Authority by keeping the Nobility at a diſtance from the management of State-Affairs, and empoveriſhing the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they might not be able to carry on a deſign againſt the Government.</p>
               <p>But ſince theſe Politic cautions were not ſufficient to reſtrain a Nation that had been accuſtom'd to a Boundleſs Liberty, and was always ready to revol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon the leaſt Provocation; She made it her buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to gain Creatures and to form a Party in the Kingdom that might be able to maintain her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62547:28"/>and baffle all the Attempts of her Enemies. For the more effectual Proſecution of that deſign ſhe caſt her Eyes upon the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who were very potent both by reaſon of their vaſt Riches and the great Number of their Vaſſals: Nor cou'd ſhe have taken a better way to curb the fury of a grumbling and <hi>Superſtitious People</hi> who thought themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to be govern'd by the Maxims of their <hi>Spiritual Guides.</hi> There was not a Church in <hi>Sweden</hi> that did not receive ſome conſpicuous Marks of her Bounty: She augmented the Power and confirm'd all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Biſhops, and afterwards admitted 'em to a ſhare in the Government, that their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and the Preſervation of their Grandeur might oblige 'em to maintain the Authority of the Crown.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops gain'd by ſuch high and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Favors, devoted themſelves to the Intereſt of the Court; and the inferior Clergy follow'd their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, both by reaſon of their dependence upon their Superiors, and becauſe the Favor of the Court, and the Queen's Recommendation to the Chapters were the moſt effectual means to obtain a Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick. The Lords and Gentlemen, who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready jealous of the Riches and Power of the Clergy, cou'd not without Grief and Indignation behold this new Addition to their Authority; but they were forc'd to content themſelves with repining in ſecret during the life of the Queen. For that wiſe and powerful Princeſs entertain'd Private Spies among the Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Party; and by that means was acquainted with all their Reſolutions, and enabl'd to break all the Meaſures they cou'd take to ſhake off the Yoke ſhe had impos'd upon 'em.</p>
               <p>After her Death, King <hi>Eric</hi> ſucceeded in the Three Kingdoms, but did neither inherit her Power nor her Prudence. He retir'd to <hi>Denmark,</hi> and ſent Governors to <hi>Sweden</hi> who treated the People of that Kingdom rather as <hi>diſarm'd Enemies,</hi> than as <hi>free
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62547:29"/>Subjects.</hi> The Nation was over-loaded with Taxes, and fill'd with Soldiers, who domineer'd over the wretched Inhabitants, and not only robb'd and plunder'd 'em without Controul, but added ſcorn and Inſolency to their unmanly Barbarity. The Officers conniv'd at theſe Diſorders, and rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd than check'd the Offenders. From whence we may reaſonably conclude that either they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a ſhare of the Booty, or had ſecret Orders to tolerate theſe Abuſes. The Complaints of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd did not reach the Ears of the Prince, or were rejected with Diſdain: Nor cou'd they hope to ſee an End, or ſo much as an Alleviation of their miſery without an entire Alteration of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore they reſolv'd in ſo deſperate a caſe to have recourſe to the moſt violent remedies and to free themſelves from a Power that ſeem'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt at its firſt Eſtabliſhment, and was now become Tyrannical and inſupportable.</p>

               <p>He took advantage of the miſunderſtanding that was betwixt King <hi>Eric</hi> and the <hi>Danes.</hi> This Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch ſeeing himſelf Maſter of Three Great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms

               <p>The Tyrannical Diſpoſition of this Prince made him ſo odious to his Subjects, that all the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms conſpir'd againſt him; and the Revolt was ſo general; that there were none left to ſupport him.

               <p>That Lord had obſerv'd ever ſince <hi>Engelbrecth's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> were weary of being under the Dominion of a Foreign Power: And from that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time he began ſecretly to aſpire to the Crown, and to draw a Scheme of his future Advancement. His Office made him Maſter of the Forces and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia of the Kingdom; he govern'd a large province, and was the richeſt Lord in <hi>Sweden.</hi> The Eſtates being aſſembled at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> the <hi>Great Mareſchal</hi> came thither at the Head of ſo numerous a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Finlandiſh</hi> Lords and Gentlemen, that 'twas generally concluded he wou'd be Maſter of the Election. He repreſented to the Aſſembly that the Treaty of <hi>Calmar</hi> was extreamly prejudicial to the whole Kingdom; that Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> and the Kings her Succeſſors had always made uſe of that pernicious Law as a Means and pretext to bring <hi>Sweden</hi> under Subjection to the Crown of <hi>Denmark;</hi> that the <hi>Danes</hi> treated 'em rather like <hi>Slaves</hi> than <hi>Allies,</hi> aſſuming a Power to impoſe a Sovereign upon 'em, without calling 'em to his Election; and that they cou'd only blame themſelves for ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a Treatment, if they did not abrogate and diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul a Treaty that was ſo diſhonourable to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe rais'd the languid Courage of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and awaken'd their ancient Averſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Government. It put 'em in Mind of the Tyranny of King <hi>Eric;</hi> and every Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to accuſe himſelf of Weakneſs and ſtupidity for ſubmitting to the Prince of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> The Election of the Count of <hi>Oldenburgh</hi> was rejected with a great deal of Vehemency;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1448"/> and the Royal Dignity was conferr'd upon the <hi>Great Mareſchal</hi> as a Recompence for the Zeal he had always profeſs'd for the Intereſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62547:31"/>of his Country. At the ſame time he manag'd the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of <hi>Norway</hi> ſo dexterouſly, and had ſo great an Influence over 'em, that he was choſen Sovereign of that Kingdom, whither he went, and was Crown'd at <hi>Drunthlin,</hi> and intruſted the Government of the State to two of the Principal Lords of the Country.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Biſhops had been devoted to the Crown of <hi>Denmark,</hi> ever ſince Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd them before the Nobility in the Government of the Kingdom. They only gave their Conſent to the Election of the <hi>Great Mareſchal,</hi> becauſe they cou'd not oppoſe it; and were vex'd to behold the Increaſe of his power and Authority. He was not ignorant of their Spie and Averſion againſt him, and that they were only diſſatisfied becauſe he did not allow 'em a ſhare in the Government. If he had conſider'd their temporal Authority, he would have ſoon perceiv'd that it was his true Intereſt to gain 'em: But he thought himſelf ſo well ſettl'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne, that 'twas beyond the power of his moſt potent Adverſaries to diſturb the Quiet of his Reign. He reſolv'd to humble thoſe lofty Prelates, and concluded that the moſt effectual Way to make 'em harmleſs and ſubmiſſive to the Government, was to deprive 'em of part of thoſe vaſt Riches, which ſerv'd only to make 'em terrible to their Sovereign. He obtain'd an Order of the Senate to make an Exact Inquiry into all the Rights of the Crown,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1452"/> and the public Revenues which the Clergy had uſurp'd; and ordain'd that no perſon for the future ſhou'd erect any new <hi>Foundations,</hi> under pretext that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of the People wou'd give the Clergy an Opportunity by Degrees to make themſelves Maſters of all the Lands in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops and other Eccleſiaſticks were extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incens'd at this <hi>Declaration.</hi> They affirm'd publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the King was a <hi>Heretick,</hi> and endeavour'd to perſwade the people that this Invaſion of their <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:62547:31"/>Eſtates was only made uſe of as a Cloak to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more pernicious Deſigns, and that the Blow was aim'd at <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf. To prevent the pretended Conſequences of a Regulation that touch'd 'em in the moſt ſenſible part, they reſolv'd to take up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, and engag'd their Relations, Vaſſals, and Creatures in the Conſpiracy. To favour their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd Revolt, <hi>John de Salſtat</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Upſal,</hi> of the Illuſtrious Family of <hi>Bielke,</hi> diſpatch'd a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman with ſecret Inſtructions to <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> I. King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to invite him to <hi>Sweden,</hi> in order to the Re-eſtabliſhment of the Treaty of <hi>Calmar.</hi> And leaſt that Prince ſhou'd be diſcourag'd by the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difficulty of the Attempt, he aſſur'd him that all the Biſhops of the Kingdom wou'd ſecond his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and that they were ready to receive him as their Sovereign into all their Cities and Forts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> was then in <hi>Norwey,</hi> whither he went upon a like Invitation from a Party that revolted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt King <hi>Canuton:</hi> But notwithſtanding the War in which he was engag'd in that Kingdom, he ſent a powerful Army to ſupport the Intended Rebellion of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Clergy. Aſſoon as Archbiſhop <hi>Salſtat</hi> receiv'd advice of the <hi>Danes</hi> appearing on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, he call'd a <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> of the Clergy, to be held at <hi>Upſal,</hi> where he excommunicated the King in a ſolemn Maſs which he ſaid on that occaſion. After the Office was ended he laid his Eccleſiaſtical Ornaments and Habits upon the Altar, ſwearing that he wou'd never put 'em on again till he had driven that Prince out of the Kingdom. Then he took a <hi>Cuiraſs</hi> and Sword, and went out of the Church in that warlike Equipage at the head of his Vaſſals to fight againſt his Soveraign. The reſt of the Biſhops follow'd his Example, and took up Arms for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their Privileges. They joyn'd openly with the <hi>Danes,</hi> and long'd to ſee their Country under the Dominion of Foreign Princes who during their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62547:32"/>neceſſary abſence, left the Clergy in poſſeſſion of all the marks of Sovereignty, and even of a large ſhare of the Royal Authority. They ſcrupl'd not to fight againſt the King at the Head of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and the whole Kingdom was diſtracted with a dreadful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Civil and Foreign Wars.</p>
               <p>Yet that Prince might have eaſily diſperſt the Clouds that ſeem'd to threaten him with inevitable Ruin, and might have triumph'd over the joint Forces of his Foreign and Domeſtic Enemies, if he cou'd have contented himſelf with the Regal Dignity and the Revenues that were annex'd to the Crown. But he began too ſoon to domineer over his new Subjects, and not only impos'd unuſual Taxes upon the People, but invaded the Privileges of the Nobility, without reflecting on the fatal conſequences of diſobliging thoſe to whom he ow'd his Crown and Authority. By theſe violent proceedings he loſt ſeveral of his beſt Friends, and the moſt conſiderable Lords of the Kingdom. The Arch-Biſhop, taking advantage of this Miſunderſtanding, routed the King's Army which was already weaken'd by the Deſertion of the Nobility, and purſu'd him to <hi>Stockholm</hi> whither he retir'd after the Loſs of the Battle. That unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prince perceiving that the Nobility had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken him, and that he had neither Forces nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to undergo a Siege, was ſo afraid of falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of his Enemies that he left the Kingdom, and retir'd to <hi>Dantſick</hi> with a Deſign to raiſe Forces in <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and to appear once again in <hi>Sweden</hi> at the Head of an Army.</p>
               <p>In the mean Time the Arch-Biſhop was receiv'd into <hi>Stockholm,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1457"/> where he caus'd <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> I. to be proclam'd King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> That Prince was ſtill in <hi>Norway,</hi> but as ſoon as he had ſettl'd his Affairs there, he march'd immediately to <hi>Sweden,</hi> and was receiv'd as Sovereign of the Kingdom. The Arch-biſhop flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd himſelf with the Expectation of Governing the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62547:32"/>Kingdom, and imagin'd that <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> wou'd in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Predeceſſors content himſelf with the Title of King; but that Prince declar'd openly that he was reſolv'd to keep the power in his own Hands, and did not think fit to gratify the Ambition of his Benefactor. The haughty Prelate finding himſelf ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly ſlighted, and (as he thought) ungratefully treated, expreſs'd his Diſſatisfaction in Terms that were not much different from a poſitive Menace. But <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> knowing him to be a Perſon of a turbulent and daring Temper was ſo far from complying with his Humor, or endeavouring to appeaſe his Paſſion, that he order'd him to be apprehended, and ſent him under a ſtrong Guard to <hi>Denmark. Catil</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincopinc,</hi> the Arch-biſhop's Nephew, took up Arms immediately to revenge the Affront that was put upon his Uncle, and having in a little time rais'd a conſiderable Body of Soldiers, had the good fortune to obtain ſeveral Victories over that Prince's Army. <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> perceiving that his Army was not ſtrong enough to keep the Field, in oppoſition to that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, diſperſt his Forces into the Places that were in his Poſſeſſion, and return'd to <hi>Denmark</hi> to Levy a ſufficient Number of Men to recruit and augment his Army.</p>
               <p>Biſhop <hi>Catil</hi> remain'd Maſter of the Government during the War, which laſted almoſt ſeven Years. He offer'd ſeveral times to receive the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> into the Kingdom, if he wou'd ſet the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop at liberty: But that Monarch was too proud to ſubmit to a forc'd compliance, and ſcorn'd to own the Reduction of <hi>Sweden</hi> to any but himſelf. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutſon's</hi> Friends perceiving that the Breach grew-ſtill wider, took advantage of ſo favourable a Juncture, and prevail'd with <hi>Catil</hi> to conſent to the King's Reſtoration. Aſſoon as that Prince receiv'd the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come News he return'd to <hi>Sweden,</hi> and re-mounted the Throne after he had liv'd ſeven Years in Exile;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62547:33"/>but he ſaw himſelf quickly reduc'd to his former Condition.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1464"/> This unexpected Revolution open'd the King of <hi>Denmark's</hi> Eyes, and convinc'd him of the Error he had committed in diſobliging the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: He endeavor'd to regain their Favor by ſetting the Arch-biſhop at liberty, and that Prelate aſſur'd him that he wou'd raiſe a new Inſurrection againſt King <hi>Canutſon. Chriſtiern</hi> was engag'd in a War with the Count of <hi>Holſtein</hi> who had invaded <hi>Jutland,</hi> ſo that he cou'd not at preſent ſpare any Soldiers: but he furniſh'd the Arch-biſhop with a conſiderable ſum to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>y Forces in <hi>Sweden,</hi> and order'd a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his Guards to wait upon him, that he might enter the Kingdom with an honourable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance.</p>
               <p>The Arch-biſhop was met and receiv'd on the Frontiers by Biſhop <hi>Catin</hi> and all his Followers. He blam'd 'em for contributing to King <hi>Canutſon's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration; and 'twas reſolv'd by all that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Dethrone him a ſecond time. The War broke forth again with more fury than ever: and not long after there was a bloody Battle fought on the Lake <hi>Meler</hi> which was then frozen, where the King was ſo entirely defeated that he had not Men enough leſt to ſecure his Retreat, ſo that he was forc'd to put himſelf into the Hands of his Enemies. The Arch-biſhop made him renounce the Title of <hi>King</hi> and afterwards confin'd him to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in <hi>Finland,</hi> which he allow'd him for his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
               <p>This Prelat was not ſo fond of King <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> as before, nor to forward to acknowledge him as King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> His Impriſonment had given him a clearer view of the Policy and Temper of that Prince; and he had found by experience that 'tis ſometimes dangerous for a Subject to put too great obligations on his Soveraign. He reſolv'd to enjoy the Fruit of his Victory, and to ſhare the Supreme
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62547:33"/>Authority with the principal Lords of his Party.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1457"/> Thus <hi>Sweden</hi> had the Misfortune to be made the Scene of a confus'd and fatal <hi>Anarchy,</hi> and to groan under the Tyrannical Dominion of as many Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns as there were Lords that cou'd raiſe any Forces, or were Maſters of a Caſtle or Fort. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private Quarrel was the occaſion of a War, and the contending Parties made uſe of the Names of King <hi>Canutſon</hi> or King <hi>Christiern,</hi> to cover their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up in Arms with a Pretence of Authority, tho' at the bottom they did not own the Right or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of either of theſe Princes.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1468"/> This Scene of Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der laſted four Years, during which Time the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was perpetually diſtracted with inteſtine Wars; and the people were ſo weary of a liberty that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd 'em to ſo many and ſuch terrible Miſeries that they demanded the Reſtauration of King <hi>Canutſon</hi> with extraordinary Eagerneſs and Importunity, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring an eaſy <hi>Subjection</hi> to a wild and troubleſom <hi>Freedom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus after ſo many Revolutions that Prince had the good Fortune to mount the Throne a third Time. He was ſolemnly inveſted with the Title and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a King, and was put in poſſeſſion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City; but the Biſhops and Lords retain'd their Authority over the Provinces. He did not long ſurvive this happy turn of his Fortune, and was ſo ſenſible at his Death of the Difficulties with which the Sovereign of an elective State muſt reſolve to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1470"/> that he advis'd his Nephew <hi>Steno Sture</hi> whom he appointed to ſucceed him, to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the Quality of <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> for fear of provoking the Jealouſy of the Lords by aſſuming a more elevated Title. The Eſtates, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Death, approv'd the choice he had made, and the advice he had given his Succeſſor. The Biſhops and the Nobility fearing that if he were inveſted with the Royal Dignity, he wou'd re-demand the Tributes,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62547:34"/>Revenues, and Forts which they had ſeiz'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd the Title of <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> and in that Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity intruſted him with the Command of the Army, and the Government of the State.</p>
               <p>The Dignity of <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> was properly a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion during the <hi>Inter-Regnum</hi> or Vacancy of the Throne, which might be revok'd and made void by the <hi>Eſtates.</hi> He was by his Office the General of the Kingdom, and had a more immediate Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Soldiers and Officers, who took an Oath of Fidelity to him. The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Upſal,</hi> as Chief Senator, which was a Dignity annex'd to his Office, had the Precedency in publick Solemnities and on Days of Ceremony; but in Time of War the Sovereign Power was lodg'd in the Perſon of the <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> and he enjoy'd all the Authority of a <hi>King,</hi> tho' he durſt not aſſume the Title. The <hi>Swedes</hi> were ſo afraid of abſolute Power, that they dreaded the very Name of <hi>a King,</hi> and imagin'd that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd a greater Liberty under an <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> tho' his Authority was not Inferior to that of a <hi>King,</hi> and might be advanc'd as high as he had the Courage and Dexterity to raiſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> the Firſt endeavour'd ſometimes by <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and ſometimes by <hi>Force</hi> to aboliſh that Dignity, and re-eſtabliſh the <hi>Union of Calmar.</hi> The <hi>Biſhops</hi> were ſtill devoted to his Intereſt, and declar'd in his Favour as often as they cou'd diſcover their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without Danger. During the ſpace of Four and Forty Years, that Monarch and King <hi>John</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond his Son, govern'd <hi>Sweden</hi> by Turns with the <hi>Adminiſtrator Steno,</hi> and <hi>Suanto Sture:</hi> For it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd not unfrequently that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> were at the ſame Time Maſters of ſeveral Provinces according as the Faction of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, or the Party of the Nobility prevail'd. In the mean time neither of 'em cou'd make themſelves Abſolute in a Kingdom where the Sovereigns were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62547:34"/>oftentimes oblig'd to part with ſome Branch of their Prerogative, to purchaſe the Obedience of their Subjects.</p>
               <p>Such was the State of <hi>Sweden,</hi> when it began to be made the Theatre of the moſt memorable Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions that ever happen'd in the North, which may be juſtly reckon'd the Foundations of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Monarchy,
<note place="margin">Charles XI. <hi>King of</hi> Sweden, <hi>of the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Branch of</hi> Deux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponts <hi>is the Grand-ſon of</hi> Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine de Vaſa, <hi>the Daughter of</hi> Charles <hi>of</hi> Suderma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, <hi>and Wife of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimir <hi>Count Palatine of the</hi> Rhine.</note> and of the Grandeur of that Family which at preſent poſſeſſes the Throne.</p>
               <p>After the Death of <hi>Swanto Sture</hi> the laſt <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the Factions and Parties, which by his Power and Policy he had broken and diſperſt, began to break forth with freſh Violence. He ow'd his Advancement to his own Merit, and to the need the Kingdom had of his Protection: For he was choſen <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> at a time when that Dignity ſeem'd to be inſtituted on purpoſe to oppoſe the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the <hi>Danes.</hi> His Victories over the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> rais'd his Glory and Reputation, and made his Memory Illuſtrious.</p>
               <p>His Power was almoſt equal to the Authority of the moſt Abſolute Monarchs. He was Fortunate in War, and reſpected in Peace. he oblig'd <hi>John</hi> II.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1504"/> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> by the Terror of his Arms, to make a Truce with <hi>Sweden;</hi> and eſtabliſh'd Peace and Plenty among his People. The Nobility and Peaſants look'd upon him as the <hi>Protector of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Liberty;</hi> and his Merit procur'd him the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of ſome of the Biſhops, whom he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to diſingage themſelves from the Daniſh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>He never undertook any important Affair, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imparting his Deſigns to <hi>James Ulfonis</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Upſal,</hi> and <hi>Heming Gadde</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copine:</hi> For tho' thoſe Prelates were Enemies to his <hi>Dignity,</hi> they cou'd not forbear loving and eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Perſon.</hi> He ſhew'd an extraordinary Reſpect to the <hi>Senate,</hi> and affected ſo little Superiority over
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62547:35"/>the <hi>Noble men,</hi> that he ſeem'd only to excel 'em in <hi>Merit,</hi> tho' he was willing that People ſhou'd know that this was rather an Effect of his <hi>Moderation,</hi> than of <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Meanneſs of Spirit.</hi> He kept always a conſiderable Body of <hi>Standing Forces,</hi> that his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might never find an Opportunity to Surprize him, before he was prepar'd to receive 'em. His Court and Houſhold were compos'd of the Officers of his Army; he maintain'd 'em with his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues in time of Peace, and made 'em his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Favorites. Theſe prudent Maxims which he obſerv'd in the Management of all his Affairs, made him the Terror of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and their Faction, who durſt never engage in any Attempt againſt <hi>Sweden,</hi> during his Government.</p>
               <p>After his Death, the Senate call'd a Meeting, or <hi>Convention of the Eſtates</hi> at <hi>Arboga,</hi> to proceed to the Choice of a Succeſſor. The Biſhops, led by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of their private Intereſt, endeavour'd to ſupport the Claim of the Kings of <hi>Denmark,</hi> under whoſe Reign they had always the largeſt Share in the Government, and leſt no Means unattempted to revive the Union of <hi>Calmar.</hi> They repreſented to the Eſtates, that Plenty and a flouriſhing Trade, were the happy Effects of the Obſervance of that Treaty in <hi>Norway;</hi> that this was the only Way to change the preſent Truce with <hi>Denmark</hi> to a ſolid Peace, which cou'd not but be extreamly Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to <hi>Sweden;</hi> and that on the contrary, the Election of an <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> wou'd make the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the Seat of a bloody and pernicious War, ſo long as there were any Kings in <hi>Denmark</hi> able to maintain the Juſtice of their Pretenſions to the Crown of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe Arguments were not much regarded by the reſt of the Aſſembly, who were convinc'd that theſe deſigning Prelates wou'd, for their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, bring the Nation under a Yoak that was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62547:35"/>Grievous and Inſupportable to all the other Eſtates of the Kingdom. The greateſt part of the Deputies declar'd aloud, That they wou'd have an <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator,</hi> and the Biſhops were forc'd to comply with the prevailing Opinion. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Upſal</hi> was the firſt that gave his Vote, and declar'd in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Senator <hi>Eric Trolle,</hi> who was a prudent and deſerving Perſon; and beſides recommended by his Age, Birth, Riches, and Alliance to the late <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator.</hi> The Archbiſhop, to prevent any Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that might be made againſt that Senator's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, aſſur'd the Friends and Relations of the late <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> that 'twas only the Reſpect he had for the Memory of that Great Man, which made him name <hi>Trolle</hi> for his Succeſſor; adding, That by this means <hi>Swanto</hi>'s Son, who by reaſon of his Youth, cou'd not be ſuppos'd to be yet Maſter of ſo much Skill and Experience as was requir'd for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of ſo great a Truſt, wou'd have an Excellent Opportunity to fit himſelf for the Management of Affairs, and to learn the Art of War under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of his Kinſman, who by reaſon of his old Age, cou'd not keep him long from the Poſſeſſion of his Father's Dignity.</p>
               <p>But this was only a ſpecious Pretence to cover his hidden Deſigns. He had reſum'd the old Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of the Clergy after the Death of <hi>Swanto,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther began now to diſcover thoſe Inclinations which he durſt not own under the Reign of that wiſe and powerful Prince. <hi>Eric Trolle</hi> was his intimate Friend, and he was not ignorant of his ſecret Affection and Dependence on the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> by reaſon of a conſiderable Eſtate which he had in that Kingdom. 'Tis true, that Lord was a very Wiſe and Judicious Perſon, but he had neither Courage nor Reſolution,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62547:36"/>and both his Age and Inclination made him Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of engaging in a War with <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides the Archbiſhop concluded, That the Fear of loſing his Eſtate in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the ſure Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a conſiderable Recompence, wou'd have ſo great an Influence over him, that he wou'd be eaſily perſwaded to accept of this Dignity by way of Truſt, and afterwards make uſe of the Power it gave him, to make the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> Maſter of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>But all theſe Politick Contrivances were fruſtrated, by the unconquerable Averſion with which the <hi>Swedes</hi> were poſſeſs'd againſt all that were ſuſpected to favour the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Intereſt. The Lay-Senators, the Nobility, the Deputies of the Provinces, and Conſuls of <hi>Steckholm,</hi> agreed unanimouſly to exclude <hi>Eric Trolle,</hi> and at the ſame time declar'd for the young Prince <hi>Steno.</hi> The Biſhops and their Faction perſiſted obſtinately in the Choice of <hi>Trolle;</hi> and the Heat of the Two contending Parties began to occaſion a terrible Diſorder in the Aſſembly. But the Noble-men and Deputies maintain'd the Intereſt of Prince <hi>Steno</hi> with ſo much Zeal and Vigor, that the Biſhops finding they cou'd not ſafely oppoſe his Advancement any longer, ſubmitted to the plurality of Voices, and even ſeem'd to approve what they cou'd not prevent.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1513"/> Thus the young Prince was at laſt inveſted with a Dignity which he ow'd to the Merit and Memory of his Father.

               <p>By the Articles of this Agreement, the young <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator</hi> was oblig'd to conſent, that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop ſhou'd reſign his Benefice and Dignity to <hi>Eric Trolle</hi>'s Son.

               <p>Theſe were the principal Arguments with which theſe Grave Politicians endeavour'd to convince the Adminiſtrator of the Dangerous Conſequences of the propos'd Agreement: But in this, as well as in moſt other caſes, it appear'd that the Force of <hi>Reaſon</hi> is not able to curb the unbridld Heat of <hi>Youth.</hi> The young Prince wanted Experience, and was unwilling to be govern'd by that of others: He was dazl'd with the Splendor of his new Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and cou'd not think himſelf ſecur'd in the Poſſeſſion of his beloved Grandeur, ſo long as his Title was controverted by ſo powerful a Rival.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62547:38"/>him to bear the mortifying News of the Election of a new <hi>Adminiſtrator:</hi> And he imagin'd, that by the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Clergy, he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an eaſie Victory over a Prince whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was not yet firmly eſtabliſh'd. He wrote with his own hand to that young Prelate, to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate his late Advancement, and ſent him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Sum of Money as a Token of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trolle</hi> was conſecrated at <hi>Rome,</hi> and receiv'd the <hi>Pallium</hi> from Pope <hi>Leo</hi> X. In his return to <hi>Sweden,</hi> he paſs'd by <hi>Lubeck,</hi> which at that time was the principal and moſt potent City of all the <hi>Hanſe-Towns,</hi> and had engroſs'd the whole Trade of the Northern Kingdoms. There he ſound a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom King <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> had ſent to engage him in his Party. The <hi>Daniſh</hi> Miniſter, who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Maſter's moſt ſecret Deſigns, after he had deliver'd his Credentials, told the Archbiſhop in the King's Name, that His Majeſty cou'd not forbear taking this occaſion to repeat the Aſſurances of his Friendſhip, and that he hop'd to ſee the <hi>Union of Calmar</hi> reviv'd by his Aſſiſtance, and by the Intereſt and Power to which the Dignity of his Office gave him ſo juſt a Title.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trolle</hi> was not ignorant of the Intereſt and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Family; and both his Father and the old Archbiſhop had taken care to engage him in their Faction. He told the Gentleman that he was fully perſwaded of the Juſtice of his Maſter's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to the Crown of <hi>Sweden;</hi> and pray'd him to aſſure that Prince, in his Name, that he was very ſenſible of the Obligations which the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration both of his Office and Family laid upon him, to promote the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Intereſt; and that as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62547:38"/>ſoon as he had taken Poſſeſſion of his Archbiſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, he wou'd endeavour to give His Majeſty the moſt convincing Marks of his Zeal and Affection to his Service.</p>
               <p>He had afterwards ſeveral private Conferences with King <hi>Chriſtiern</hi>'s Agent, during his abode at <hi>Lubeck.</hi> The <hi>Dane</hi> finding him to be of a haughty and imperious Temper, and extreamly proud of his new Dignity, and of the Grandeur of his Family, reſolv'd to attack him on the weak ſide, and to make him an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> as well as a <hi>Friend</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmark.</hi> He inſinuated with a great deal of Art, that he was oblig'd, in Juſtice to himſelf, and to the Honor of his Family, to reſent the Affront that was put upon his Father; and added, That he cou'd never believe that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Merit wou'd tamely bear the Arrogancy of an Inſolent Youth.</p>
               <p>He repreſented to him afterwards, That the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of an <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> was a late Invention of the Nobility to elude the Treaty of <hi>Calmar.</hi> That by this means the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> were depriv'd of their undoubted Right to the Crown of <hi>Swedon;</hi> and the Prelates of that Kingdom excluded from the Share which thoſe Princes allow'd 'em in the Government. Then finding that his Diſcourſe had made a conſiderable Impreſſion on the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop's Mind, he added, as it were to comfort him after ſuch Melancholy Reflexions, That in all probability the young Adminiſtrator wou'd not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long in the Poſſeſſion of his Dignity; That the King his Maſter was reſolv'd to inſiſt upon the Execution of the Treaty of <hi>Calmar;</hi> That his Claim wou'd be aſſerted by <hi>Coarl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62547:39"/>of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> his Brother-in-law; That he was at Peace with all the <hi>Hanſe-Towns;</hi> That the City of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> which formerly pretended to preſerve an Equality betwixt the <hi>Northern Crowns,</hi> was not now in a Condition to aſſiſt <hi>Sweden;</hi> That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick was ſo weaken'd by the late War, in which it was engag'd for the ſpace of ten Years againſt the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> that the Regency were wholly taken up with contriving Expedients to re-eſtabliſh their Trade, and wou'd think themſelves oblig'd to <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> if he wou'd conſent to confirm and maintain the Peace which they had obtain'd; That his Maſter was endeavouring to make a League with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> and that as ſoon as the Truce betwixt <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> expir'd, he wou'd enter the laſt of theſe Kingdoms at the Head of his Army, to maintain his Right, and eſtabliſh his Authority. He added, That he had Orders to aſſure him in his Maſter's Name, That his Majeſty wou'd entruſt him with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during his Abſence, and advance him to the ſame Poſt which the Archbiſhops of <hi>Upſal</hi> enjoy'd under the Reign of his Predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>The haughty Prelate liſten'd attentively to a Propoſal that flatter'd his Ambition. He look'd upon the Kindneſs he had lately receiv'd from the <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> as a meer forc'd Condeſcention; and inſtead of loving and honouring him, as his Benefactor, he began to hate and ſuſpect him as a ſecret and implacable Enemy of his Family, and one who was oblig'd by Intereſt to humble and oppoſe him. He fancy'd that he might aſpire to the Authority which that Prince enjoy'd, and even that he might obtain it, by devoting himſelf entirely to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:62547:39"/>
               <p>Having conſider'd all the advantageous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch a Revolution, he repeated his Proteſtations to the <hi>Envoy,</hi> that he wou'd imitate the moſt Zealous of his Predeceſſors in their invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Fidelity to the Crown of <hi>Denmark.</hi> But ſince he was not well acquainted with the preſent State of a Kingdom from which he had been ſo long abſent, 'twas reſolv'd and agreed upon betwixt 'em, that he ſhou'd ſpend ſome time in reviving and increaſing the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Faction; and that the King ſhou'd from time to time ſend private Agents to take an account of the Strength and Condition of their Party, and to concert the ſureſt and moſt convenient Meaſures to put their Deſigns in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Daniſh</hi> Envoy having finiſh'd his Negotiation return'd to his Maſter; and the Arch-Biſhop em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd for <hi>Sweden</hi> with a full reſolution to Plot the ruin of the Adminiſtrator.</p>
               <p>Tho' that Prelate was educated at <hi>Rome,</hi> he had made but a ſlender progreſs in the Arts of Subtilty and Diſſimulation, that are ſo induſtriouſly taught at that Court. He was naturally of a ſtiff and violent Temper, more learned than Politic, proud of the Riches and Power of his Family and abſolutely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by his Humor. He was extremely imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and haughty, and even incapable of Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance: he hated his Superiours, cou'd not endure his Equals, and ſlighted his Inferiours, among whom he reckon'd all thoſe who were not ſo rich as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He was ſo far from regulating his Behaviour to the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> according to the Maxims of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, that he did not ſo much as obſerve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rules of decency. He induſtriouſly avoided that Prince, who in an obliging manner came out
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62547:40"/>of his Palace to meet him; and aſſoon as he came aſhore, he went by Land to <hi>Upſal</hi> without ſending any compliment to the Adminiſtrator, as if he had forgot both his Dignity and Kindneſs.</p>
               <p>He ſpent the firſt days after his Arrival in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Compliments of his Suffragans, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his Clergy. His Relations and Friends, and the chief Perſons of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Faction went to viſit him, ſome to congratulate his advancement, and others to diſcover his humor, and obſerve his Behaviour to the <hi>Adminiſtrator.</hi> In the mean time there was nothing to be ſeen at <hi>Upſal</hi> but Feaſting and Rejoicing, which laſted above a Month; for that young Prelate affected ſo extraordinary a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, and his Friends and the Creatures of his Family were ſo numerous, that he was attended with a Court which in ſome meaſure obſcur'd that of his the Soveraign.</p>
               <p>But they were not ſo wholly intent upon their pleaſure, as to forget Politicks and Affairs of State. 'Twas during theſe Feaſts and in the heat of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment that the violent and impetuous Prelate began to diſcover his Diſſatisfaction. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd to his Friends of the Injury which he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was done to his Father in the late Election; and even cou'd not forbear ſaying publickly that <hi>Steno</hi> wou'd have had but few Voices if the Election had been free. Afterwards he diſcours'd in private with the Biſhops to diſcover their Inclinations to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to know what confidence he might place in their Aſſiſtance, if he ſhou'd be engag'd in any Deſign againſt the Adminiſtrator. He inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as it were by way of common diſcourſe; that 'twas to be fear'd the end of the Truce with <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> wou'd be the beginning of a bloody War; that he was perſwaded <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> wou'd leave no Means
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62547:40"/>unattempted to re-eſtabliſh the Union of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms upon the Foot of the Treaty of <hi>Calmar,</hi> notwithſtanding the Election of an <hi>Adminiſtrator;</hi> that he pity'd the miſerable condition of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which, in all probability, wou'd be Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd to the ambition of theſe two Princes; that he knew not what ſide the Clergy ought to take, in caſe of an open Rupture; that 'twas true the Office of the <hi>Administrator</hi> ſeem'd to be inſtituted for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Nation and the Preſervation of it's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; but that the Pretenſions of the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> were founded on a juſt Claim; and beſides that thoſe Princes ſeem'd only to contend for the Title of Kings of <hi>Sweden,</hi> that they might entruſt the Clergy with the whole care and Authority of the Government.</p>
               <p>He added that Time and their Advice wou'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him what meaſures he ought to obſerve with the King of <hi>Denmark:</hi> But as for Prince <hi>Steno,</hi> he declar'd that he was ſo fully convinc'd of the violent and indirect Methods that were us'd in his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he did not think the Clergy oblig'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and ſupport the Dignity of the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> againſt the <hi>Danes,</hi> ſo long as that Prince was poſſeſt of it.</p>
               <p>The Arch-biſhop's Diſcourſe was receiv'd with an univerſal Applauſe by his Suffragans. They una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly declar'd for the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and even ſome of the moſt violent of 'em were of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they ought immediately to invite him to break the Truce, and ſurprize Prince <hi>Steno,</hi> whom they reckon'd an Uſurper; and that at the ſame Time each Prelate ſhou'd oblige the Towns and Caſtles in their reſpective Juriſdictions to own the Juſtice of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> pretenſions. Others thought it neceſſary to put all Things in a Readineſs to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62547:41"/>your the Invaſion, and without loſing Time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage all their Friends and Vaſſals in the Deſign: and in the general all the Biſhops endeavour'd to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie each other in expreſſing their Complaiſance to their Primate and an entire Reſignation to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which they were the more willing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, becauſe the intended Invaſion was yet but an uncertain project, and both the War and the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that attend it ſeem'd to be at a Diſtance.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the Arch-Biſhop made it his Buſineſs to enquire into the Number and Strength of his Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals. He ſent a Body of Soldiers to take poſſeſſion of the Fort of <hi>Steque,</hi> which belong'd to the Arch-Biſhoprick, and furniſh'd it with Stores and Amuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if the War had been already declar'd. He oblig'd his Friends and Relations to give him new Aſſurances of their Aſſiſtance, and by his Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Liberality engag'd a conſiderable Number of 'em to remain with him.</p>
               <p>The miſunderſtanding betwixt that Prelate and the <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> and the preparations that were made by his Creatures and the reſt of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Faction, gave Occaſion to People to believe that the Kingdom wou'd quickly be made the Scene of a Civil War. <hi>Upſal</hi> became the general Rendevous of all the <hi>Male-contents,</hi> and of thoſe ſtragling <hi>Adventurers,</hi> who are always ready to offer their Service upon the firſt Appearance of a Faction, and are afterwards as apt to deſert or betray their party, as they are variouſly acted by Fear or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. They were extreamly well receiv'd by the Arch-Biſhop, who heard with pleaſure their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt the Government, and ſeem'd to be touch'd with a Sence of their Grievances. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to expreſs his Diſſatisfaction by his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and all his Actions, that the diſatisfacted
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62547:41"/>Party might be encourag'd to make their Addreſſes to him: but he carefully avoided every Thing that might give the People Occaſion to ſuſpect his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the <hi>Danes,</hi> who, he knew, were generally hated by the whole <hi>Swediſh</hi> Nation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Clergy. And therefore he took care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate his Behaviour in ſuch a Manner, that his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and averſion againſt the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> might be thought to proceed from a private Quarrel betwixt the two Families, in which the Eſtate was not at all concern'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> was equally ſurpriz'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd at the News of theſe Tranſactions. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that the Arch-Biſhop was preparing for a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and was ſo enrag'd at that Prelate's Ingratitude, that being naturally of an impatient and fiery Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he wou'd have immediately march'd againſt him at the Head of his Army, if his Council had not moderated his Fury. They told him that <hi>Princes</hi> muſt not proceed in ſuch Caſes like <hi>private Perſons;</hi> that his Anger and Reſentment wou'd only ſerve to ſtrengthen the Arch-Biſhop's Party, and augment the Number of the Male-Contents; that he had to do with a People who were extremely Jealous of their Liberty, and always ready to oppoſe the Attempts of their Sovereigns: and therefore they advis'd him to conceal his Indignation, and to endeavour to gain that Prelate by gentle and obliging Methods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Steno</hi> ſubmitted to their Opinion, and under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of taking a Journey to ſome Lands that belong'd to him, he paſs'd through <hi>Upſal,</hi> which lay directly in his Way, and is but ten <hi>Swediſh</hi> Leagues from <hi>Stockholm.</hi> He alighted at the Arch-Biſhop's Palace, and went to viſit him with all the Demonſtrations of Joy and an obliging Confidence that cou'd be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by a Prince who had Reaſon to believe that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62547:42"/>his Dignity and Kindneſs wou'd procure him a hearty Welcom. After he had congratulated his happy Return to the Kingdom, he told him that he was extreamly glad that he had had an occaſion to conttibute to his Advancement, and began to complain in a very kind and obliging Manner that he had not yet appear'd at the Court. And in the general he omitted no Expreſſions of Kindneſs and Civility that might appeaſe the Anger of that ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born-Prelate, and bring him back to a Sence of his Duty.</p>
               <p>The Arch Biſhop who was both vex'd and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at that Prince's Arrival anſwer'd his Careſſes with a Conſtraint and Diſturbance that appear'd vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly in all his Actions. However he entertain'd him with extraordinary Magnificence; but that was meerly an Effect of his vanity, and deſign'd rather to diſplay his Power and Riches, than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Joy and Gratitude for the Honor the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator had done him. Nor cou'd he forbear in the Heat of their Diſcourſe to reproach that Prince indirectly for uſing violent Methods, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Dignity which was only due to the Merits of his Father.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> who was loath to quarrel with a Man whom he purpoſely came to oblige, began to juſtify his Election; but that haughty Prelate won'd not ſo much as condeſcend to hear his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and told him with a great deal of heat that the Time wou'd come when a free <hi>Convention of the Eſtates</hi> wou'd do Juſtice to his Father, and to all thoſe who were diſſatisfied with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Prince was equally ſurpriz'd at the Arch-Biſhop's Threatnings, and incens'd at his Pride and Inſolency. He retir'd with a Reſolution to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62547:42"/>imploy all his Power and Intereſt to humble him; and leaſt the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which uſually takes hold of ſuch Occaſions to extend its Authority, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of protecting the Clergy, ſhou'd inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in this Affair, the Adminiſtrator wrote to the Pope to complain of the Inſolence and ill Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of that Prelate.</p>
               <p>Not long after the Pope return'd an Anſwer full of kind and obliging Expreſſions. He blam'd <hi>Trolle</hi> for his Turbulency and ingratitude, and added that he had ſent Orders to his <hi>Legat</hi> who was then at the Court of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to go immediately to <hi>Sweden</hi> and in his Name to admoniſh the Arch-Biſhop of his Duty.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding thoſe ſpecious pretences, the Inſtructions he gave to his <hi>Legate</hi> were intended rather for a Complement than a real Satisfaction: For tho' he ſeem'd to blame the Arch-Biſhop, he cou'd not but rejoyce in his Heart that both he and the other Prelates of the Kingdom, whom the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> is wont always to look upon as her Subjects and Creatures, ſhou'd extend their Power, and aſſume a Share in the Government of the State. And beſides the Popes had always bore a ſecret Averſion to the Kings, and Sovereigns of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> ſince thoſe Princes had diſcontinu'd the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Tribute uſually call'd St. <hi>Peter's Pence.</hi>

               <p>Several Popes had in Vain demanded that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute;

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62547:43"/>the leaſt impreſſion upon thoſe Princes: So that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was at laſt oblig'd to give over its ſucceſsleſs Attempts upon a People, whoſe Eyes were open'd rather by <hi>Policy</hi> than <hi>Learning,</hi> and who by an early and unanimous Reſolution had ſhaken off the Fear of Ecclefiaſtical Cenſures. The <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> was admoniſh'd by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who were acquainted with the Inclinations and Politicks of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> not to rely upon the Pope's Aſſiſtance in ſo dangerous a Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: Nor did he place ſo much Confidence in the Apoſtolical Letters, but at the ſame Time he took more effectual Meaſures for the Defence and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Authority.</p>
               <p>He ſummon'd a Meeting of the <hi>Eſtates</hi> at <hi>Tellia,</hi> under pretext that the Truce with <hi>Denmark</hi> was ready to expire; but in effect to procure a new Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Title and Authority, and at the ſame time to diſcover the Strength of the Archbiſhop's Party.</p>
               <p>That Prelate, on the other hand, made it his Buſineſs to gain more <hi>Friends</hi> to the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and to raiſe new Enemies to the <hi>Adminiſtrator.</hi> He exacted freſh Aſſurances of Fidelity from thoſe of his Party, and even engag'd the Governours of the Caſtles of <hi>Stockholm</hi> and <hi>Nicopinc</hi> in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Faction. Afterwards he ſent a truſty Meſſenger to King <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> to give him an Account of the preſent Poſture of Affairs, and of the Condition of his Party; and to intreat him to advance imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately at the Head of his Army, without ſtaying for the end of the Truce, which he might eaſily find ſeveral plauſible Pretexts to violate. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he order'd his Agent to aſſure him, That the Government of the Caſtles of <hi>Stockholm</hi> and <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinc</hi> wou'd declare in his Favour, and receive his Forces into the Places under their Command.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:62547:43"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> replied to theſe Solicitations, that it wou'd not be ſufficient to break the Truce, unleſs the Eſtates of <hi>Denmark</hi> wou'd contribute to the War againſt <hi>Sweden;</hi> that he was endeavouring to engage the principal perſons of the Kingdom in that Deſign; that he believ'd he had already gain'd the Legate that was going to <hi>Sweden;</hi> that if the Negotiation of that Prelate ſhou'd not be attended with ſucceſs, he wou'd take care to ſtart ſome difference betwixt the Two Nations, and puſh it on ſo far that the Eſtates of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſhou'd be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to take up Arms in the defence of the Nation.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Eſtates of <hi>Sweden</hi> Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Tellia,</hi> where the Adminiſtrator had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed 'em to meet; and he had the pleaſure to ſee that moſt of the Deputies were the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had contributed moſt effectually to his Advancement. This encourag'd him to ſummon the Arch-Biſhop to repair thither, in order to his qualifying himſelf for his Office, by taking the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Oath of Fidelity to the Eſtates. But that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late not daring to appear in an Aſſembly, where his Enemy had ſo ſtrong a party, ſhut himſelf up in the Fort of <hi>Steque,</hi> which was a Caſtle ſeated on the top of a Hill, and equally fortifi'd by Art and Nature. The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Upſal</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all imaginable care to render it Impregnable, according to the Rules that were obſerv'd in thoſe days; and beſides, it was ſufficiently ſecur'd by the privileges of the Clergy which made it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Sanctuary. The Arch-Biſhop call'd a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Biſhops and others of his Faction, and the Aſſembly was held in that Caſtle, as if the Convention at <hi>Tellia</hi> had neither been free nor lawfully call'd. Thus both parties were making preparations for an open Rupture,

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62547:44"/>his Mediation to negotiate an Agreement betwixt the Arch-Biſhop and the Adminiſtrator.</p>
               <p>The Legate was of a ſmooth and pliant Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, extreamly Polite and Complaiſant, and ſeem'd to make the getting of Money his principal Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the main Object of his Deſires He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, among his other Commiſſions, to be intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with a full power to grant Licenſes for the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fleſh on Fiſh-days, to thoſe who wou'd be at the charge of purchaſing a diſpenſation. At the ſame time he diſtributed indulgences to all thoſe who wou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute a certain ſumm for the Building of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church at <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe new Projects for draining the People of their Money were ſet on foot about that time, and carry'd a little too far by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> under the Pontificate of <hi>Leo</hi> X. though perhaps without his knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arcemboldi,</hi> ſcrap'd together thoſe profitable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, with all the greedineſs of a Soldier that is ſent to levy Contributions. He had fleec'd a part of <hi>Denmark</hi> under the protection of his Bulls, and not ſatisfy'd with the conſiderable ſumms he had rais'd in that Kingdom, he put his Money out to Intereſt, or imploy'd it in Merchandizing, when he was preparing for his departure to <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> was extreamly diſſatisfy'd with the Commiſſion and Behaviour of that Legate, who under a Religious pretext drew all the Money out of his Dominions; but he durſt not expreſs his diſpleaſure. He cou'd not hope to ſucceed in his deſign againſt <hi>Sweden,</hi> without the aſſiſtance of the Clergy, and he was fraid leaſt they wou'd become his Enemies, if he ſhou'd quarrel with the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus he was forc'd to purchaſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of that Prelate at the rate of expoſing his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as a prey to his Avarice. He over-loaded him with Careſſes and Obligations during his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and at his departure he receiv'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62547:44"/>his laſt viſit with the higheſt Demonſtrations of kindneſs and Civility.</p>
               <p>He pray'd him to imploy the intereſt and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to which his Character entitl'd him for the Eſtabliſhment of a firm and laſting Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Two Kingdoms. He aſſur'd him that he was ready to conſent to any reaſonable expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents for the carrying on of ſo good a deſign, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the <hi>Swedes</hi> wou'd engage to put the Treaty of <hi>Calmar</hi> in execution. He added that neither the Civil Wars, nor the moſt ſucceſsful Rebellions cou'd be ſuppos'd to make void the Obligation of ſo ſolemn a Treaty; that the Clergy and all the honeſt party in the Kingdom look'd upon the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that was agreed upon in that famous Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as the trueſt way to eſtabliſh a ſolid and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Peace betwixt the Two Nations; and that this was the only fault which the Adminiſtrator cou'd object againſt the Arch-Biſhop. He pray'd the Legate to protect that Prelate from the unjuſt Rage of a raſh and inſolent youth; and concluded that he hop'd he wou'd put ſome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Captain of Rebels, and a Soveraign, whoſe Family had been always devoted to the intereſt of the holy See.</p>
               <p>The Legate was not ignorant that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was extreamly well pleas'd with the <hi>Danes,</hi> and very much diſſatisfy'd with the <hi>Swedes;</hi> and beſides he knew that King <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> was ally'd to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> for which the Pope had an extraordinary reſpect: but the moſt prevailing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that engag'd him in that Prince's ſervice was the conſideration of the Money he left in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and of that which he hop'd to get at his return, in ſome Provinces where he had not yet publiſh'd his Indulgences. He aſſur'd the King that he wou'd proſecute his deſigns with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Vigor and Zeal, and even inſinuated to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62547:45"/>him that he had ſecret orders to favour his pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and protect his Creatures, adding, that under the ſeeming Character of a Mediator, would he promote his Intereſt, and ſerve him with as much Fidelity and Affection as he cou'd expect to find in his own Miniſters.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> relying upon theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations diſcover'd his moſt ſecret deſigns, and talk'd to him with more freedom than a Prince ought to uſe with a Foreign Miniſter. He told him, that he was ſure of the Caſtles of <hi>Stockholm</hi> and <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinc,</hi> that all the Biſhops were ready to receive him into the places that were under their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and that the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Upſal</hi> who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd the whole deſign wou'd come over to his Army aſſoon as he ſhou'd appear on the Frontiers of the Kingdom. He entreated the Legate to confer with that Prelate, if it were poſſible to keep any Correſpondence with him without giving peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple occaſion to ſuſpect the deſign of their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. He deſir'd him alſo to concert with the Arch-Biſhop the ſureſt and moſt convenient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to put their project in execution.</p>
               <p>The Legate left <hi>Denmark</hi> with theſe Inſtructions, and as ſoon as he arriv'd at the Court of <hi>Sweden,</hi> he publickly exhorted the Adminiſtrator and the Senate in the Pope's Name to conclude a firm and laſting Peace with <hi>Denmark.</hi> Some days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he demanded a private Audience of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator, in which he intreated that Prince to grant the honour of his Friendſhip to the Arch-Biſhop, and not to diſturb that Prelate in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a dignity which the Pope conferr'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him meerly at his Recommendation. <hi>Steno</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in few Words, and with a great deal of Courage and Reſolution, that he wou'd always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Holineſs's deſires with Submiſſion and Reſpect, and have an honourable regard for the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62547:45"/>Perſon of his Legate; but withal he told him, that he ought in the firſt place to offer his Advice and Admonitions to the Arch-Biſhop, who he aſſur'd him might enjoy his Dignity without the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance or moleſtation, if he wou'd return to a ſence of his duty.</p>
               <p>The Legate who only waited for an occaſion to enter upon the Subject of his Negotiation, told the Prince that he had receiv'd orders from the Pope to offer and conſult about the beſt expedients for bringing the difference betwixt him and the Arch-Biſhop to an amicable agreement, and for eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a firm and durable peace between <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark;</hi> and that he perceiv'd that the latter could hardly be accompliſh'd without the former. He pray'd him to accept the mediation of the holy See, he exhorted him to prefer a ſolid Peace before the uncertain chance of Warr, which perhaps wou'd not be equally agreeable to all the Eſtates of the Kingdom, and wou'd make him odious even to the Nobility and Commons, if it ſhou'd happen to be prolong'd beyond their Expectation, or if they ſhou'd be diſappointed of their hope of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe and the care the Legate took to confound the Arch-Biſhop's Affair with the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s pretenſions, made the Adminiſtrator ſuſpect the intentions of that Prelate, who he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded was gain'd by his Enemies, and acquainted with all their Deſigns. He knew how much it was his intereſt to diſcover the bottom of their project; but 'twas not an eaſie Task for a young <hi>Swediſh</hi> Prince to pump a ſecret out of an <hi>Italian</hi> Prelate, who had been train'd up in the art of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And therefore inſtead of endeavouring to unriddle the myſtery by over-reaching that crafty Miniſter in an art of which he was an abſolute Maſter, he reſolv'd to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62547:46"/>attack him on the weak ſide; and in purſuance of that deſign, he intreated him, by the advice of the Senate, to diſtribute his indulgences in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, aſſuring him that during that time he wou'd take ſuch meaſures as might be conducive to the publick good, and agreeable to the inclinations of the holy Father.</p>
               <p>This contrivance had all the ſucceſs that cou'd be deſir'd: The Legate was extreamly glad of ſo favourable an opportunity of continuing his gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trade with ſo fair a proſpect of Advantage, which was the only deſign of his Legation to the Northern Countries. He was afraid that if the Two Nations ſhou'd come to an open Rupture, 'twould be impoſſible for him to purſue his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in <hi>Sweden,</hi> and that the tumultuous confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of War wou'd deprive him of the profits of his Miſſion, for which 'twas thought he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd a conſiderable Summ to the Apoſtolical Chamber. And therefore as ſoon as he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the conſent of the Adminiſtrator and Senate, he publiſh'd his Bulls thro the whole Kingdom, and his Officers took care to diſperſe 'em thro all the Provinces. Thoſe under-Collectors, or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd Beggars whom he carry'd about with him, were certain perſons who had farm'd the right of publiſhing his Bulls, and were oblig'd to purchaſe their Leaſes for a conſiderable ſumm of Money. 'Twas always his Cuſtom to agree with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bidder, without regarding the qualifications of thoſe mercenary Preachers, provided they cou'd give him ſufficient ſecurity for the payment of his Money.</p>
               <p>The Adminiſtrator, either out of Policy or Devotion, ſeem'd very deſirous of obtaining theſe indulgences. He was very liberal on that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in imitation of his example the Senators and all the Nobility laid out conſiderable ſumms
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62547:46"/>of Money on theſe Commodities. The common people who are uſually the beſt cuſtomers at ſuch Markets, emptied their pockets to ſecure their Souls: every one was willing to contribute to the pious deſign, and even the wildeſt Debauches ſeem'd to grow fond of the modiſh Devotion, which the Adminiſtrator had brought into faſhion, and were eaſily perſwaded to ſubmit to a pennance that tended only to mortifie their purſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arcemboldi</hi> amaſs'd a prodigious Treaſure in <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vit. Archiep. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal. Joan. Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</note> and the Adminiſtrator ſuffer'd him to export the Money in <hi>Specie,</hi> without paying any Cuſtoms or Duties. This was a very conſiderable favour; for all the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> exacted a third part of the profits of the indulgences that were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in their Dominions. And as a further mark of his kindneſs he ſent ſeveral magnificent preſents to the Legate, and among the reſt a conſiderable quantity of rich Furs, and a very large Table of maſſy Silver.</p>
               <p>The Adminiſtrator imagining that he had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely gain'd the Legate by ſo many obliging De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of his Favour, and by the richneſs of his preſents, ſome time after took an occaſion to diſcourſe with him in private. After he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of the Arch-Biſhop's ingratitude, he told the Legate that he had receiv'd a full information of that Prelate's pernicious deſigns, and that he was reſolv'd either to bring him to a ſence of his duty, or to make him leave the Kingdom. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemboldi</hi> was ſo charm'd with that Prince's liberality that he acknowledg'd the Juſtice of his reſolution, and even cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d not forbear diſcovering the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s ſecret. He thought his Conſcience oblig'd him to beſtow his favours, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the moſt bountiful returns, and perhaps was afraid that the Adminiſtrator was already acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the inſtructions he had receiv'd from the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62547:47"/>King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and wou'd ſtop the Money he had rais'd in the Kingdom, if he ſhou'd ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to conceal ſo dangerous a ſecret. Reſolving then to make the beſt advantage of a diſcovery which perhaps he cou'd not prevent, he gave the Prince a full account of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, of the correſpondence he entertain'd with the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Clergy, and of the infidelity of the Governours of the Caſtles of <hi>Stockholm</hi> and <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet for his own ſecurity he made the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator promiſe to carry on his deſign with ſo much prudence and caution, that the Arch-Biſhop might not have the leaſt occaſion to ſuſpect that he had betray'd King <hi>Chriſtiern</hi>'s Secret. At his Return to <hi>Denmark,</hi> he ſeem'd to be extreamly afflicted with the ill ſucceſs of his Negotiation. He told the King that the Adminiſtrator was ſo exaſperated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Arch-Biſhop, that there was no hope of a ſpeedy Reconciliation; that in his opinion that Prelate was an obſtacle to the Re-eſtabliſhment of the Treaty of <hi>Calmar;</hi> that he kept himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſhut up in the Caſtle of <hi>Steque,</hi> from whence he ſeem'd to threaten the Adminiſtrator with a Civil War; that he did not think it convenient to go thither, leaſt <hi>Steno</hi> ſhou'd have ſuſpected his deſign; that the Adminiſtrator was poſſeſs'd with an extraordinary Averſion againſt the perſon of that Prelate; and that he had Reaſon to believe that though 'twere poſſible to prevail with the Prince to reſign his dignity, he wou'd never be perſwaded to conſent to that propoſal, while he thought it might prove advantageous to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> perceiving the ill ſucceſs of the Legate's Negotiation, concluded that he cou'd never make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Sweden</hi> but at the head of a powerful Army. He conſider'd alſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62547:47"/>that the Truce was not yet expir'd, and that he cou'd not begin the War without the conſent and approbation of the Eſtates of <hi>Denmark:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave private orders to his Admiral to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the firſt <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ships he ſhould meet with, not doubting but that the Adminiſtrator wou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to revenge ſuch an indignity, by way of Reprizal or Retaliation, either by Land or Sea, which wou'd oblige the Eſtates and Senate of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> to declare War againſt <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the Adminiſtrator took all poſſible care to fruſtrate the deſigns of his Enemies; and reſolv'd to make the beſt improvement of the Legate's diſcovery without betraying his ſecret. He inform'd the Senate that ſeveral perſons in the Kingdom were engag'd in a Conſpiracy againſt the State, and that the Governours of <hi>Stockholm</hi> and <hi>Nicopinc</hi> had betray'd their Truſt, and were ready to receive the Enemies into the places which they commanded. The Senate was alarm'd at the News of ſo black a deſign, and pray'd him to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Traytors. He pretended to take a review of the Gariſon of <hi>Nicopinc,</hi> and as ſoon as the Governour and Soldiers came out of the Fort he order'd a new Garriſon to take poſſeſſion of the place, under the Command of a Governour who was abſolutely devoted to his Intereſt. At the ſame time he gave orders to arreſt the Governour of the Caſtle of <hi>Stockholm,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Septemia.</note> who attended at Court ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his uſual Cuſtom.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1516"/> Then he call'd a meeting of the Eſtates at <hi>Weſteras,</hi> the Capital Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Weſtmannia,</hi> where thoſe two Governours were accus'd of contriving and abetting a Treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable deſign againſt their Countrey, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were appointed to draw their Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The fear of puniſhment and the hope of a pardon made ſo ſtrong an impreſſion upon 'em, that they confeſs'd their deſign to deliver up theſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62547:48"/>places to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and accus'd the Arch-Biſhop as the Author and Fomenter of the Conſpiracy.</p>
               <p>The Adminiſtrator having this advantage over him, reſolv'd to proceed againſt him with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Rigour; and in order to his Conviction or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him to be ſummon'd to give an account of his Behaviour to the Eſtates. Some of the Senators who were ſenſible of the dangerous tendency of theſe diviſions, and dreaded the fatal conſequences of an open Rupture, endeavour'd under-hand to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Arch-Biſhop to ſubmit to the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator, and even offer'd him a ſafe Conduct ſign'd by the principal Members of the Eſtates, hoping to divert the threatning ſtorm, and to gain the ſtubborn Prelate by eaſie and gentle methods.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Biſhop was enrag'd to find that his deſigns were blaſted by too early a diſcovery: he complain'd to his Friends of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s remiſſneſs and neglect, and immediately ſent one of his Creatures to that Prince to acquaint him with the danger to which his party in <hi>Sweden</hi> was expos'd, and to haſten his March to that Kingdom. In the mean time to amuſe the Senate, he deſir'd that a new Convention of the Eſtates might be ſummon'd, under pretext that the greateſt part of the deputies that compos'd the Aſſembly at <hi>Weſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> were either the Creatures or Relations of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd Enemy.</p>
               <p>The Eſtates were ſo incens'd at the Pride and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of that religious Prelate, that they reſolv'd to ſecure his perſon and bring him to a Tryal. They intreated the Adminiſtrator to inveſt the place where he reſided; and at the ſame time orders were given out to apprehend his Father, and ſuch of his Friends and Relations as were ſuſpected to be privy to his deſigns againſt the Government, or might be ſuppos'd to be able and willing to take
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62547:48"/>up Arms in his Defence. And ſince they foreſaw that theſe Proceedings would infallibly occaſion a Rupture with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator was deſir'd to raiſe the Militia, and to put the Kingdom in ſuch a poſture, that it might not be in danger to be ſurpriz'd by its Enemies.</p>
               <p>The Breach betwixt the Arch-Biſhop and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, gave the Prince an occaſion to revenge a private quarrel, under the plauſible pretext of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing a publick Enemy, and that he might not loſe ſo favourable an opportunity, he gave Orders immediately for a general Rendezvous of all the Nobility and Militia of the Kingdom. His Friends and Relations repair'd to his Aſſiſtance at the head of their Forces, every one ſtriving to ſignalize his Fidelity to his Country, and Affection to the Prince, in a War that was undertaken to maintain his Election, and defend the Liberty of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Among all the Noblemen who aſſiſted the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator on this occaſion, there was none who expreſſed a more vigorous Zeal for his Intereſt then <hi>Guſtavus Ericſon,</hi> the great Standard Bearer of the Crown: A young Lord about Six and Twenty Years of Age, deſcended from the ancient Kings of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and particularly from King <hi>Canutſon,</hi> who was his great Uncle. He was the Son of <hi>Eric Vaſa,</hi> Governour of <hi>Finland,</hi> and Couſin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to the Adminiſtrator, with whom he was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. He had naturally a high and daring Spirit, his Soul was poſteſs'd with an eager deſire of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and infinitely more ſenſible of the Manly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Ambition, than of the ſofter Charms of Pleaſure. The Adminiſtrator divided his Favour and Confidence betwixt him and his Father; but the old Age of that Senator, and a certain Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs that appear'd in all his Actions, made ſuch an impreſſion upon the Prince, that tho
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62547:49"/>he did not eſteem him leſs for theſe Diſadvantages, he took more pleaſure in <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> who with an equal ſolidity of Judgment, was Maſter of more Courage and Strength of Mind, and never propos'd any Deſigns or Expedients, but what were ſuitable to the Bravery, and agreeable to the Inclinations of his young Maſter.</p>
               <p>'Twas by his Advice that the Prince reſolv'd to give Fire Arms to the <hi>Peaſants,</hi> who till then, had only, or for the moſt part, made uſe of Bows and Arrows. The Adminiſtrator order'd a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of Muſquets to be brought to <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and put on Board a Ship, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Adminiſtrator was not ſo diſcourag'd by this Loſs, as to give over the deſign he had form'd againſt the Arch-Biſhop. He put himſelf at the head of the Militia or Infantry, which was the moſt numerous Body in his Army, and gave the Command of the Horſe to <hi>Gaſtavus.</hi> The Biſhops of <hi>Stregnez</hi> and <hi>Lincopinc</hi> march'd before, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of interpoſing their Intereſt and Mediation, to bring their Primate to a Sence of his Duty; but their real Deſign was to give him notice of the Strength and Condition of the Adminiſtrator's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For though the Prelates were engag'd both by Intereſt and Inclination in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Faction, as well as the Arch-Biſhop, they were more Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Cunning, and took care to conceal their real Sentiments, the diſcovery of which cou'd nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be advantageous to their Party, nor ſafe for

               <p>The Adminiſtrator met the <hi>Danes</hi> near the Caſtle of <hi>Wedel;</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1517"/> and <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was the firſt who charg'd 'em at the head of a Squadron. The Action was very bloody, and the Victory was for ſome time diſputed on both ſides with all the obſtinacy which is uſually obſerv'd in thoſe firſt Encounters, on the event of which the honour of the Nation and the ſucceſs of the Campaign ſeems to depend. But at laſt the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Troops were defeated, and the greateſt part of 'em cut to pieces: thoſe who had the good fortune to eſcape made a diſorderly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to their Ships, and retir'd to <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince aſcrib'd all the glory of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Action to <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> who after he had attack'd the Enemies with a great deal of Vigour, ran in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themidſt of 'em with his Sword in his hand, and purſu'd 'em to their Veſſels, without giving 'em time to Rally. 'Twas upon this occaſion that the Prince began to conſider him as an uſeful perſon, whom before he had only lov'd as an agreeable Companion. He admir'd the ſurprizing genius of that young Lord, his eager inclination to War, his Courage, Valour, and above all the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary preſence of Mind he had ſhewn in the firſt Eſſay of his Arms. He was the beſt Judge of ſuch Qualities as theſe, and naturally inclin'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer 'em before other endowments: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they made a ſtronger and more laſting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon his Mind.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:62547:50"/>
               <p>After ſo conſiderable a ſucceſs, the Prince led back his Victorious Troops to the Siege of <hi>Steque.</hi> The Arch-Biſhop was extreamly alarm'd at the News of the intire defeat and flight of the <hi>Danes,</hi> who abandon'd him to the mercy of his Enemies; for he imagin'd that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> wou'd have taken more effectual meaſures to ſupport and relieve him. The Biſhops, and the reſt of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were ſo over-aw'd by the Prince's power that they durſt not declare againſt him and even thoſe who were moſt ſuſpected were either ſecur'd, or driven out of the places that were under their Command. In the mean time the beſiegers car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd on their Works to the foot of the Wall: but tho the Arch-Biſhop was not able to make a longer reſiſtance, the natural Pride and fierceneſs of his Temper, and his implacable averſion againſt the Adminiſtrator wou'd not ſuffer him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to a Treaty. He defended the Caſtle for ſome days with all the fury and obſtinacy of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Man who reſolves to bury himſelf under the ruins of the Walls that encloſe him: but the Officers of the Garriſon were of another opinion, and fearing to be treated as Rebels if the place ſhou'd be ſtorm'd and they found in Arms againſt their Prince and Countrey, forc'd their haughty Governour to Capitulate.</p>
               <p>He deſir'd to treat with the Adminiſtrator in perſon, and offer'd to come to his Tent provided <hi>Guſtavus</hi> ſhou'd be deliver'd as a Hoſtage. <hi>Steno</hi> conſented to that propoſal, and <hi>Gustavus</hi> enter'd the Caſtle at the ſame time that the Arch-Biſhop came out of it in order to attend the Adminiſtrator. But he was ſo ſcar'd with a ſence of his guilt, that he durſt neither rely upon the exchange nor the Faith of a Treaty, which is reckon'd an inviolable ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity according to the Law of Nations. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowing how dear <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was to the Prince,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62547:51"/>that he might at leaſt have the pleaſure to taſt the cruel delights of Revenge, he left orders with the Officers of the Garriſon, to cauſe that Lord to be hang'd on the Battlements of the Caſtle, if they ſhou'd receive advice that the Adminiſtrator treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as a Priſoner.</p>
               <p>When he came before the Prince he deſir'd leave to Capitulate, with as much confidence as if he had been defending the place, for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Countrey, againſt the publick Enemies of the Nation. But the Adminiſtrator, deſiring that the obſtinacy of that Prelate might be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Crime againſt the State, and a downright Rebellion, refus'd to enter into a Treaty, and in the name and behalf of the Eſtates of <hi>Sweden,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, that a Garriſon might be put into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. He told the Arch-Biſhop that 'twas the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate's buſineſs to give Judgment concerning his behaviour; and to regulate the conditions of the Treaty; adding that he wou'd not appear in the Senate till they had decided that affair; and that he wou'd neither be his Friend nor his Judge, ſince he refus'd to acknowledge his Authority.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Biſhop, who was ſtill as haughty and inſolent as ever, imagin'd that the Adminiſtrator, notwithſtanding his ſeeming Reſolution, referr'd the deciſion of their difference to the Senate, on purpoſe that ſome of the Members of that illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Body might offer their mediation in order to a friendly agreement. Upon this Conſideration he ſurrender'd the Caſtle to the Prince, and having obtain'd a ſafe Conduct or protection, took Journey to <hi>Stockholm</hi> accompany'd with a numerous Train of his Followers, and attended with as magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent an Equipage, as if he had triumph'd over all his Enemies. He ſanfy'd that his intereſt with the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> wou'd ſtrike ſuch a Terrour into his Judges, that they would think themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62547:51"/>ſatisfy'd by his pretending to be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; concluding that they wou'd look upon his Revolt, as a private quarrel betwixt him and the Adminiſtrator, occaſion'd by the jealouſie of the Government, and wou'd expect no other Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than a bare acknowledgment of that Prince's Authority.</p>
               <p>But he was quickly made ſenſible of his Error, and of the vanity of his Airy Hopes; for as ſoon as he arriv'd at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> they began to proceed againſt him with Vigour. The Senate finding that they might ſafely rely upon the aſſiſtance of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator, who was ſtill at the head of his Army, gave judgment againſt that Prelate; and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Lincoping, Stregnez,</hi> and <hi>Scara,</hi> who were Members of that Body, were oblig'd to ſubmit to the plurality of Voices, and to ſubſcribe his Condemnation, for fear of being ſuſpected and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted as Favourers and Abettors of his Rebellion. He was declar'd an Enemy to his Country, and 'twas ordain'd by the Senate that he ſhou'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reſign his Title to the Arch-Biſhoprick, that he ſhou'd retire to a Monaſtery to do Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for all the Diſturbances his Ambition had rais'd in the Kingdom; that the Fort of <hi>Steque</hi> which had encourag'd the <hi>Danes</hi> to invade <hi>Sweden;</hi> and under the former Arch-Biſhops had been always made a Sanctuary and Retiring-place for Rebels and diſaffected Perſons, ſhou'd be demoliſh'd, that publick Thanks ſhou'd be given to the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for his Diligence in ſtifling the Rebellion; and that the whole Kingdom ſhou'd unanimouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to maintain the authority of that Prince, and the Decree of the Senate, in caſe the Pope thro' miſ-information or prejudice, ſhou'd endeavour to reſtore the Arch-Biſhop.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:62547:52"/>
               <p>This Decree was enter'd in the publick Regiſters, ſign'd by all the Senators, Spiritual and Temporal; and in execution of theſe Orders, the Fort of <hi>Steque</hi> was demoliſh'd, and the Arch-Biſhop forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Dignity. He deliver'd his Reſignation in full Senate, to be tranſmitted to the Pope; but at the ſame time, he ſent one of his Creatures to <hi>Rome,</hi> to complain of theſe violent Proceedings, and to beg the Protection of the Holy See.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> engag'd all his Friends at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to employ their Intereſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and defend that Prelate, whoſe Abdication had blaſted all his Deſigns, and ruin'd his Party in <hi>Sweden.</hi> He was rather irritated than diſcourag'd at the defeat of his Forces, and made new Levies to invade <hi>Sweden,</hi> during the next Campaign; for the Eſtates of <hi>Denmark</hi> thought themſelves oblig'd to revenge the loſs they ſuſtain'd at <hi>Wedel.</hi> He ſent to <hi>Muſcovy</hi> to ſollicite the <hi>Czar</hi> to declare againſt the Adminiſtrator, and endeavour'd to prevail with the Pope, to joyn his Eccleſiaſtical Thunders to the Forces with which he deſign'd to attack that Prince.</p>
               <p>His importunity and the Arch-Biſhop's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, made ſo great an impreſſion upon the Pope, that he order'd his Legate <hi>Arcemboldi,</hi> who was ſtill in <hi>Denmark,</hi> to return immediately to <hi>Sweden,</hi> and require the Adminiſtrator to put the Arch-Biſhop in poſſeſſion of his Office and Dignity upon pain of Excommunication. The Legate, at his arrival in <hi>Sweden,</hi> employ'd all his Intereſt and Rhetorick to perſwade that Prince to give the Pope Satisfaction. He repreſented to him in private, with an ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and freedom that were not ſuitable to his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, but ſeem'd to be the effects of their former Friendſhip, and a requital of the Adminiſtrators Kindneſs, that the Anger and Diſſatisfaction of the Court of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>The Adminiſtrator communicated the Pope's Meſſage to the Senate, and acquainted 'em both with his Deſires and Menaces. The Biſhops of <hi>Lincoping, Stregnez,</hi> and <hi>Scara,</hi> who had been<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Experience he had formerly had of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate's temper, made him reſolve to ſtrengthen theſe Reaſons with a more prevailing and demonſtrative Argument; and therefore after he had ſoften'd him with ſeveral conſiderable Preſents, he offer'd him the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Upſal,</hi> and engag'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Decree of the Eſtates in his favour, impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering him to hold that Benefice, during his Life, without being oblig'd to reſide in the Kingdom.</p>

Thus inſtead of an Army of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated Troops the Adminiſtrator ſaw himſelf at the head of a vaſt Body of Tumultuary Forces who without waiting for Orders took up Arms for the preſervation of their liberty. The whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was overſpread with ſwarms of Peaſants who came flocking to the general Rendezvous, ſome deſcending from the Mountains, and others run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of the Woods. Moſt of theſe ſavage Warriors were cloath'd with the Skins of Wild Beaſts, and arm'd after a very odd and even ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous manner: but they were inſpir'd with a certain undaunted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Adminiſtrator having aſſembl'd all his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, march'd ſtraight towards the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">July.</note> who ſearing to be enclos'd betwixt the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army and the City, rais'd the Siege, and retir'd to his Ships. But the <hi>Swedes</hi> taking advantage of the motion his Troops were oblig'd to make in order to their Retreat, charg'd 'em ſo vigorouſly, that the Rear of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Army was almoſt entirely defeated. They fied to the ſhore with ſo much
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62547:55"/>precipitation and diſorder, that the greateſt part of 'em were cut to pieces; and many of thoſe who eſcap'd the Fury of the purſuers were drown'd in attempting to ſwim to their Veſſels. The <hi>Swedes</hi> made themſelves maſters of all the Baggage, and took above Three hundred Priſoners, who for the moſt part were Officers and Perſons of note that halted to ſuſtain the ſhock of the Enemy while the Soldiers were imbarking, and with the loſs of their liberty, preſerv'd the King himſelf and the greateſt part of his Army.</p>
               <p>But this was not the only Misfortune which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that diſaſtrous Expedition; for the <hi>Danes</hi> were detain'd above three Months in the Road of <hi>Stockholm</hi> by contrary Winds, and at laſt were ſo ſtraiten'd for want of proviſions that they were ſorc'd to make frequent Deſcents to ſupply their neceſſities. But they were always repuls'd by the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Cavalry, under the command of the brave <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> who was perpetually in motion, and oblig'd 'em to retire with precipitation to their Ships. His Courage and Vigilancy produc'd ſo good an effect, that the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Fleet was reduc'd to the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity: they had neither Water nor Victuals, and there was a great mortality among the Soldiers. The King himſelf was in danger of periſhing, either for want of proviſions, or by the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſtempers that began to break forth in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>To deliver himſelf out of ſo miſerable a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſent a meſſenger to the Adminiſtrator with orders to propoſe a Truce for ſome days under pretext of treating about the Ranſom of the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. After the Envoy had deliver'd his meſſage, he inſinuated dexterouſly that twou'd not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to change the Truce to an eternal peace betwixt the two Nations. The Adminiſtrator was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:62547:55"/>was reduc'd, and knew that he might eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat his Victory by ſtarving his Enemy: but either out of generoſity, or in hopes of procuring a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid peace, which wou'd have ſecur'd him in the poſſeſſionof his dignity, he conſented immediately to the Truce, and ſent ſeveral Boats laden with proviſions for the uſe of the King, and all his Navy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> perceiving that the Adminiſtrator was extreamly deſirous of a Peace, imagin'd that this might furniſh him with an Opportunity to make himſelf Maſter of his Perſon. He pretended to be overcome by that Princes Generoſity, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd himſelf extreamly oblig'd to him for the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Relief he had ſent him. Some time after, he propos'd an interview on Board the Fleet, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he invited the Adminiſtrator, in order to treat about a Peace; and for the ſecurity of his Perſon, he ſent ſeveral of the moſt conſiderable Perſons in his Army to the Court at <hi>Stockholm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince, who was naturally of a very free and candid temper, was eaſily perſwaded to give him that ſatisfaction, but the Senate oppos'd his Reſolution, either becauſe they ſuſpected that there was ſome treacherous Deſign hidden under ſo plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible a pretext, or were reſolv'd to maintain the Honour of the State in the Perſon of the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator. In compliance with their deſire, <hi>Steno</hi> ſent back the Hoſtages with freſh ſupplies of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and a Meſſage to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> by which he acquainted him that he wou'd have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conſented to the interview on Board the Fleet, but that the Senate thought it more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that the Treaty ſhou'd be manag'd by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners from both ſides in ſome place on the Frontiers, that ſhou'd be mutually agreed upon.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:62547:56"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> perceiving that the Adminiſtrator had eſcap'd the Snare that was laid for him, reſolv'd upon another project to facilitate the Execution of his Deſigns. He dreaded the valour of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> and the authority of his Family in the Kingdom; and beſides, he had a particular ſpite againſt him, for his Affection and Fidelity to the Adminiſtrator. He projected a Contrivance, to make himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his Perſon, and of five or ſix other Lords in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army, imagining, that by threatning to put theſe Officers to death, he might oblige the Adminiſtrator to conſent to the Re-eſtabliſhment of the Treaty of <hi>Calmar,</hi> or at leaſt, hoping to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a difference betwixt the Prince, and the moſt conſiderable Families in the Kingdom, if he ſhou'd refuſe upon any Terms, to ſave the Lives of <hi>Guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi> and his Companions.</p>
               <p>In purſuance of this deſign, he propos'd an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview in the City of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> offering to repair thither with ſome of his Council, provided <hi>Guſtavus</hi> and ſix other Lords whom he ſhou'd name, ſhou'd be deliver'd as Hoſtages for the ſecurity of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And to make both the Prince and Senate ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that 'twas their Intereſt to comply with this expedient; he repreſented to the Adminiſtrator, that they might come to a more ſpeedy agreement by conferring together, than by imploying Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries, who uſually conſume a great deal of time in debating about the Preliminaries of a Treaty.</p>
               <p>Thus the Senate was oblig'd to conſent to a Propoſal,
<note place="margin">Lawrence Sigonis, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Bennet Nicolai. George Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gones, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gadde.</note> which they cou'd not reject with any ſhadow of Reaſon. As ſoon as <hi>Guſtavus</hi> and the other Hoſtages appear'd on the Shore, the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, follow'd by a conſiderable number of Officers advanc'd to ſalute 'em; and at the ſame time they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62547:56"/>were ſurrounded by ſeveral Soldiers, diſguis'd like Mariners, who had come aſhore during the Truce, under pretext of buying Strong-Waters, and other Proviſions.</p>
               <p>Then the Admiral deſir'd 'em to go in his Boat to ſalute the King, who was coming to ſee the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator. <hi>Gustavus</hi> wou'd have willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd the Complement, and waited till the King was landed, but he ſaw ſo many <hi>Danes</hi> about him, that he choſe rather to comply with a ſeeming Chearfulneſs, than to make an uſeleſs Reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Thus he and his Companions went on Board, and were immediately carry'd before the King, who commanded 'em to be arreſted and diſarm'd, contrary to his own Promiſe, and to the Law of Nations. Afterwards he ſent word to the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator, that he wou'd order 'em to be Beheaded as bels and Excommunicated Perſons, if he would not immediately conſent to reſtore the Arch-Biſhop, and Reeſtabliſh the Treaty of <hi>Calmar. Steno</hi> was ſo incens'd at ſo baſe a piece of Treachery, that he mann'd immediately all the Boats and Ships in the Harbour.

               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:62547:57"/>
               <p>King <hi>Christiern</hi> left no means unattempted to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Fidelity of <hi>Guſtavus</hi> and his Companions: but they reſiſted with equal ſteddineſs and courage all his Promiſes and Threats, and cou'd neither be ſcar'd nor flatter'd into a Compliance with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Their Reſolution and Conſtancy had almoſt coſt 'em their Lives; for the King finding that he cou'd not gain 'em, and dreading the Courage and Indignation of <hi>Gustavus,</hi> if he ſhou'd be oblig'd to releaſe him, gave ſecret orders to put 'em to Death. But the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Officer whom he entruſted with that Commiſſion, abhorring ſo barbarous an Action, and fearing perhaps the law of Retaliation; if by the chance of War, he ſhou'd fall into the Hands of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> took the Liberty to tell his Maſter, that the Death of theſe Lords wou'd be prejudicial to his Intereſt, whereas by detaining 'em Priſoners, he might keep their Relations in awe. Theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made ſo great an Impreſſion upon the King, that he contented himſelf with impriſoning 'em in the Caſtle of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> where they were ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly treated by his Order, that ſome of 'em ended their Days in that miſerable Condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eric Banner,</hi> a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Lord, pitying the hard fate of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> who was his Kinſman, begg'd him of the King, upon his parole of Honour, and that he might the more eaſily obtain a Suit of that Nature, from that jealous and diffident Prince; he aſſur'd him, that the only reaſon that made him wiſh to have that young Lord in his Houſe, was, that he might have an opportunity to gain ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Friend to his Majeſty. That Conſideration prevail'd with <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> to grant his Requeſt; but on Condition that he ſhou'd carry his Priſoner to the Caſtle of <hi>Calo</hi> in <hi>Jutland,</hi> of which he was Governour, and ſhou'd pay 6000 Crowns of Gold
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62547:57"/>for his Ranſom, if he ſhou'd ſuffer him to eſcape, or cou'd not produce him upon Demand.</p>
               <p>The Generous <hi>Banner</hi> thought no Conditions too hard to ſave the Life of his Kinſman, which he believ'd, was not ſecure in the Caſtle of <hi>Copenhagen.</hi> He carry'd him to <hi>Calo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">October.</note> and endeavour'd by a kind and civil Entertainment, to make him forget the Miſery he had ſuffer'd at <hi>Copenhagen.</hi> The good Mien, Majeſtick Air, and graceful behaviour of that Prince, produc'd their uſual effect upon the Mind of his friendly Jaylor, who after ſome time, allow'd him the liberty of walking abroad, and ſuffer'd him to take the diverſion of Hunting. New Recreations were propos'd to him every day, and it ſeem'd to be the main Buſineſs of the Family, to pleaſe him: But all the Pleaſures he enjoy'd in ſo obliging a Society, cou'd neither make him forget that he was a Priſoner, nor give him the leaſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction while his Confinement depriv'd him of a ſhare in the Hazard and Glory of the War. His eager deſire to ſerve the Adminiſtrator in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Countrey; and at the ſame time to execute his juſt Vengeance on the perfidious Author of his Captivity, made him ſo uneaſie, that the moſt ſtudy'd Delights ſerv'd only to encreaſe his Melancholy.</p>
               <p>On the other Hand, King <hi>Chriſtiern</hi>'s Thoughts were ſo deeply ſix'd on the Conqueſt of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and his Mind was ſo agitated with the tumultuous Motions of a diſappointed Ambition, that his Spite againſt the Adminiſtrator was exaſperated by the ill ſucceſs of the Siege of <hi>Steckholm.</hi> He cou'd not forgive that Prince, for obliging him to make ſo diſorderly and ignominious a Retreat, and cutting off part of his Army. He was both vex'd and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62547:58"/>that he had publickly violated his Faith, and the Law of Nations, to no purpoſe, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Guſtavus</hi> and the reſt of the Hoſtages; but nothing afflicted him more ſenſibly than the daily decreaſe of his Party in <hi>Sweden.</hi> His Mind became a diſmal Scene of Spite, Rage, and Shame, and in the heat of his Fury, he reſolv'd to make a laſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the next Campaign, to repair all his Loſſes by the ruine of his Enemy, hoping that the ſucceſs of his Arms wou'd in ſome meaſure juſtifie him for proceeding againſt the <hi>Swedes</hi> as rebellious Subjects and excommunicated Wretches, without allowing 'em the Treatment which is uſually granted to common Enemies.</p>
               <p>He ſtood equally in need of Men and Money to carry on his Deſigns; and to ſupply the laſt of theſe Deficiencies, he gave Orders to his Officers to ſeize the Legate <hi>Archemboldi</hi>'s Treaſures, under pretext that he had laid out the Money he had rais'd by the Sale of Indulgences, on contraband Goods. But his Guilt really conſiſted in a Million of Florins, which he was going to carry out of the Northern Kingdoms, and in holding Intelligence with the Adminiſtrator. The King had heard of the ill Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices he did to the Arch-Biſhop, and was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that he had oblig'd all his Friends to make uſe of their Intereſt with the Pope, to obtain the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Upſal.</hi> And from thence he concluded, that the Dignity to which he aſpir'd with the Adminiſtrator's conſent, was the reward of his betraying the Secret, with which he had entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to that Prince, and that his Infidelity had ruin'd the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Faction in <hi>Sweden.</hi> The Proſpect of ſo profitable a Revenge, was in his Opinion a ſufficient Ground to excuſe an open violation of the Law of Nations. He caus'd the Legate to be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62547:58"/>ſecur'd with all his Effects, and that he might not be oblig'd to reſtore the Treaſure he had ſeiz'd, or ſubmit to an Examination of the Privileges, to which the Function and Character of that Prelate entitl'd him; he gave ſecret Orders to ſuffer him to ſteal out of the Kingdom, after he had been kept for ſome time in perpetual Fear of Death, that he might take hold of the firſt Opportunity to make his Eſcape. By this uſage of the Legate, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd that the ſeeming Zeal of that Prince, in executing the Orders of the Holy See, was only a Politick Contrivance to carry on his Ambitious Deſigns, which he endeavour'd always to cover with a pretext of Religion.</p>
               <p>He imploy'd the Legate's Money in making new Levies, and impos'd heavy and unuſual Taxes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Subjects, without the Advice or Conſent of the Eſtates. The Clergy and Nobility oppos'd theſe Innovations, and poſitively refus'd to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards the raiſing of the Supplies, under pretext, that neither the Taxes, nor the Declaration of the War, were authoriz'd or approv'd, either by the Senate or Eſtates. But their real deſign was to put a ſtop to his Ambition, and curb the Impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his Temper, for they were extreamly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his Deſigns, and perhaps were not leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid than the <hi>Swedes,</hi> of the Succeſs of his Arms.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, he ſqueez'd conſiderable ſums out of the common People, who are uſually the firſt who feel the burthen of Taxes, and are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never aſſiſted by the Nobility and other Eſtates, who content themſelves with ſecuring themſelves. He levy'd foreign Troops with the Money he had rais'd by theſe Impoſitions; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited all the Soldiers of Fortune, and ſtraggling
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62547:59"/>Adventurers that would enter into his Service, and even preferr'd 'em before the <hi>Danes</hi> in the Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Offices and Places, that his Arms might be lodg'd in the hands of thoſe who depended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon him. At the ſame time he prevailed with <hi>Francis</hi> I. King of <hi>France,</hi> to aſſiſt him with 4000 Foot, under the Command of <hi>Gaſton de Brezé,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Foucarmont,</hi> and the Baron of <hi>Gondrin.</hi> Thus in a little time, he had the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſee himſelf at the head of a numerous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which made him equally terrible to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Enemies. He conferr'd the Title and Authority of General on <hi>Otho Crumpein,</hi> who was eſteem'd one of the greateſt Captains in the North, and entruſted him with the management of his Deſigns, and the command of his Forces, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to leave <hi>Copenhagen</hi> at a time, when there were ſo many viſible Signs of a general Diſſatisfaction among the Senators, and the principal Lords of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Otho</hi> led his Army to <hi>Weſtgethland,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1519"/> where he made a terrible havock, to draw the Enemy to an Engagement.
<note place="margin">Febr.</note> In the mean time the Adminiſtrator march'd at the head of his Army, follow'd by Ten Thouſand Peaſants of that Province, who came vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to his Aſſiſtance. He encamp'd at the entry of the Foreſt of <hi>Tyvede,</hi> having order'd a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Trees to be cut down, to fortifie his Camp and Trenches. <hi>Otho</hi> pretended to be ſomewhat daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the ſight of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Forces, and retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſeeming Precipitation to the <hi>Lake Veler,</hi> which was at that time cover'd with Ice, upon which he encamp'd with his whole Army. <hi>Steno</hi> was ſo tranſported at the ſight of a Flying Enemy, that he was not maſter of ſo much preſence of Mind, as to reſtrain the impetuous Ardor of his Courage.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62547:59"/>He left his Infantry and the <hi>Peaſants</hi> in the Wood, where they lay entrench'd, and march'd with his Cavalry after the <hi>Danes,</hi> whom he attack'd near <hi>Bogeſund.</hi> His Valor and Example inſpir'd all the Soldiers in his Army, with a Reſolution to conquer or die. He charg'd at the Head of a Squadron compos'd of the principal Noblemen of the Kingdom; he drove back all that durſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſtand the Shock of his Attack, and broke thro' their thickeſt Ranks with ſo brave a Fury, that he was juſt ready to taſte the pleaſure of ſo glorious a Victory, when one of his Legs was ſhot off by a Cannon-builet. The <hi>Swedes</hi> were ſo diſhearten'd at the ſight of their General's Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, that they began to ſhrink and give ground. The <hi>Daniſh</hi> General was too well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Art of War, to neglect ſo fair an opportunity of ſnatching the Victory out of the Hands of a ſtaggering and diſmaid Enemy: And therefore as ſoon as he perceiv'd their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, he order'd his Cannon to be charg'd with Cartouches, and pointed at the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Cavalry; and at the ſame time he brought up his Infantry, who made a continual Fire. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry having loſt the Spirit that animated 'em, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a running Fight for ſome time; but at laſt fearing to be ſurrounded, they fled with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Precipitation and Confuſion. During the general Diſorder, the Adminiſtrator was carry'd off upon a Sledge by his Servants, and dy'd of his Wound near <hi>Stregnez,</hi> as they were bringing him to <hi>Stockholm.</hi> He was extreamly valiant; but his undaunted Courage was not accompany'd with an equal Dexterity in the Management of Affairs; In a word, he was a better Soldier than a Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and fitter to command a Party, than to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern a Kingdom.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:62547:60"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Otho,</hi> who knew as well how to improve as how to obtain a Victory, gave Orders to his Troops to march immediately againſt the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Infantry, and the <hi>Peaſants</hi> who guarded the Paſs of <hi>Tyvede.</hi> He imagin'd that he cou'd eaſily force their Trenches, and commanded the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Foot to attack 'em; but the <hi>Swedes</hi> made ſo brave a Reſiſtance, that their Enemies were oblig'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire with a conſiderable Loſs.</p>
               <p>The General, enrag'd at the Cowardice of his Men, order'd the <hi>French</hi> Infantry to renew the Attack, and at the ſame time went round the Trenches, to ſee whether he cou'd diſcover an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier Paſſage, or a Place that was not ſo ſtrongly guarded. In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carmont</hi> advanc'd at the Head of the <hi>French,</hi> and was the firſt Man who mounted the Rampart with his Sword in his hand; but immediately after he receiv'd ſo dangerous a Wound with an Arrow that he fell into the Ditch.

               <p>The Clergy imploy'd all their Intereſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent an Election, which they foreſaw wou'd be extreamly prejudicial to the Intereſt of that Prince.

And under pretext of ſecuring the Quiet and Safety of their Country, they perſwaded theſe Lords to ſend Deputies to General <hi>Crumpein,</hi> to deſire a Truce in the Name of the whole Nation, and to aſſure him, that in the mean time they wou'd take ſuch Reſolutions, as might be equally profitable to both Kingdoms, and agreeable to the King his Maſter.</p>
               <p>The cunning General wou'd not abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their Requeſt, but he took care they ſhou'd not have time to reflect upon their Condition, and upon their true Intereſt. He granted only a Truce for Eleven Days, and during that Time he requir'd that a Meeting of the Eſtates ſhou'd be held at <hi>

The Archbiſhop who by his Office was the firſt Senator, call'd the Meeting, and the Clergy us'd all their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Rhetoric to perſwade the Nobility and Commons either to come in Perſon, or ſend De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to the Aſſembly; but the greateſt Part of 'em refus'd poſitively to meet in a Place that had
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62547:61"/>declar'd for the Enemy. So that the whole Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly conſiſted only of the Biſhops; the three Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators whom they had gain'd, and ſome Lords of <hi>Weſt Gothland,</hi> who were ſcar'd into a Compliance by the Troops and Menaces of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. However the Archbiſhop open'd the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being intirely compos'd of his Friends and Creatures, was abſolutely govern'd by him. In the mean time <hi>Otho</hi> repair'd to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the principal Officers of his Army, and requir'd the Eſtates to aboliſh the Dignity and Office of an Adminiſtrator, and to re-eſtabliſh the Union of <hi>Calmar,</hi> in Favour of the King his Maſter. There was no need of uſing Arguments to perſwade an Aſſembly that conſiſted of ſuch Perſons as were already engag'd in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Faction, either by Fear or Inclination. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the General's Demands, aboliſh'd the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of an Adminiſtrator, and condemn'd the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of thoſe Princes who had born that Title, as Rebels againſt their lawful Sovereigns. And they were even ſo zealous to out-do each other, in haſtening the intire Ruin of their Country, that <hi>Otho</hi> was oblig'd to moderate their Ardor, leaſt it ſhou'd be ſuſpected that the Treaty, which he concluded with the Eſtates was only ſign'd by Traytors, or at leaſt by Perſons whoſe Conſent was extorted by violent Methods.</p>
               <p>He promis'd in the Name of the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<note place="margin">May.</note> that the Laws and Privileges of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhou'd be preſerv'd and maintain'd; that all the Articles of the Treaty of <hi>Calmar</hi> ſhould be punctually obſerv'd; that the Priſoners, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Guſtavus Ericſon,</hi> ſhou'd be deliver'd without Ranſom; and that no Perſon ſhou'd be moleſted for engaging in any Party during the War, ſince the Death of the Adminiſtrator <hi>Suanto,</hi> Then the Archbiſhop conferr'd the Title of King
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62547:62"/>of <hi>Sweden</hi> upon <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> in the name of the whole Aſſembly, as if his Sovereignty had been acknowledg'd by all the Eſtates of the Kingdom. He ſent alſo Circular Letters into all the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, intimating the Conditions of the Treaty he had concluded, and requiring all the People to ſubmit to the Reſolution of the Eſtates, upon Pain of being Proſecuted with the utmoſt Rigour for their Diſobedience.</p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>Otho</hi> march'd with his Army into the remote Provinces of the Kingdom, to make the People acknowledg the Authority of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. He routed ſeveral Bodies of the <hi>Peaſants,</hi> who cou'd not bear the ſight of their Enemies, without putting themſelves in a Poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Their Natural Courage was animated by all the Motions of Fury and Revenge; but they were equally deſtitute of Leaders and Fortune. After the <hi>Daniſh</hi> General had diſpers'd the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who fought with more Impetuoſity than Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he detach'd ſeveral Party's; who burnt the Villages, purſu'd the <hi>Peaſants</hi> to the Woods, and deſtroy'd a prodigious Number of 'em.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop, to terrify the reſt with the Fear of a Puniſhment, which the Superſtitious <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants</hi> dreaded more than Death it ſelf, prohibited the Clergy to grant Chriſtian Burial to thoſe who dy'd in Rebellion againſt the Prince, that was Authoriz'd by the Holy See. The <hi>Daniſh</hi> General deſtroy'd the Lands and Caſtles of thoſe Lords who refus'd to acknowledg his Maſter; and at the ſame time entertain'd thoſe who declar'd in his Favour, with all the Demonſtrations of Kindneſs and Civility. The Lords and Gentlemen, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd by their mutual Diviſions, were at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to yield their Necks to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Yoke, and the whole Kingdom was forc'd to ſubmit to it's new Maſter. The People ran to meet the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62547:62"/>Conqueror, and endeavour'd to make their Peace on the eaſieſt Terms. The greateſt part of the City ſent Deputy's to promiſe Obedience; only <hi>Stockholm</hi> and <hi>Calmar</hi> perſiſted in their Fidelity to the Adminiſtrator's Widow. <hi>Otho</hi> inveſted the firſt of theſe Cities and canton'd his Troops about it in ſuch a manner, that 'twas impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Town by Land. Then he wrote to the King his Maſter, to acquaint him with the Succeſs of the Campaign, and the Treaty that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded at <hi>

               </p>
               <p>The News of the Reduction of <hi>Sweden</hi> were
<note place="margin">Novemb.</note> extreamly agreeable to the Court of <hi>Denmark:</hi> but while every one ſtrove to expreſs his Joy for ſo glorious and important a Succeſs, the King who was moſt concern'd in it, cou'd not forbear diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trouble and Uneaſineſs of his Mind. That Jealous and Apprehenſive Prince was afraid, that <hi>Otho</hi> wou'd make uſe of his Name, and of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that was wholly compos'd of Foreigners, to make himſelf Maſter of the Kingdom: And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Fears ſuggeſted to him, that the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who were naturally poſſeſs'd with an implacable Averſion againſt the <hi>Danes</hi> wou'd endeavour to bribe that General's Fidelity by offering to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg him as Adminiſtrator. However he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembl'd his Suſpicions, and ſent him Letters full of Expreſſions of Gratitude for the important Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he had receiv'd from him; but at the ſame Time to keep him in awe, he acquainted him that he was reſolv'd to march to <hi>Sweden</hi> next Spring at the Head of a numerous Army, and that he wou'd command the Siege of <hi>Stockholm</hi> in Perſon Some time after he ſent ſeveral Ships laden with Salt, which was very ſcarce and dear in <hi>Sweden,</hi> and order'd the General to cauſe it to be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted <hi>Gratis</hi> among the principal Perſons of every Village, that the <hi>Peaſants</hi> might eſteem
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62547:63"/>themſelves happy, in being ſubject to ſo kind a Maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was ſoon after alarm'd with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal News of the Ruin of his Country. He was extremely afflicted at the Adminiſtrator's Death, and concluded that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> wou'd take advantage of the general Conſternation to make himſelf Maſter of the whole Kingdom. His Reſtraint became inſupportable to him, tho' he was ſtill entertain'd by <hi>Banner</hi> with all the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Tenderneſs he cou'd expect or deſire from a kind Relation. The Tranquillity of his Thoughts was perpetually diſturb'd with the moſt violent Tranſports of Revenge for the Death of <hi>Steno,</hi> and of a moſt paſſionate Love to his Country; and perhaps he had already began to form ſome ambitious Deſigns, which encreas'd the Agitation of his Mind. He was too well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Character to entertain the leaſt Hope of procuring his Liberty from that Prince before the End of the War, tho' to gain the Nobility that was made an expreſs Article of the Treaty of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal;</hi> and the natural Generoſity of his Temper, wou'd not ſuffer him to make any propoſal to <hi>Banner</hi> that might ſeem inconſiſtent with his Duty to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign. And therefore he reſolv'd to make his Eſcape privately, concluding that 'twou'd be no injury to his Kinſman, if the Ranſom appointed by the King were paid.</p>
               <p>In order to the Execution of that Deſign,
<note place="margin">Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> he went out of the Caſtle one Morning, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of hunting in the Woods, according to his uſual Cuſtom. Aſſoon as he came to a convenient Place. he diſguis'd himſelf in a <hi>Peaſant</hi>'s Habit, and in that Equipage travell'd on Foot thro' By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and in two Days arriv'd at <hi>Flensburg.</hi> Since no Man was ſuffer'd to go out of that City
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62547:63"/>without a Paſsport, <hi>Guſtavus</hi> durſt not appear at the Gate, or go before the Governor, for fear of being diſcover'd; but as if Fortune had deſign'd to favor his Eſcape, this happen'd to be the time of the Year, when the Merchants of lower <hi>Saxony</hi> come to <hi>Jutland</hi> to buy Oxen, with which they drive a conſiderable Trade. <hi>Guſtavus</hi> offer'd his Service to one of theſe <hi>German</hi> Merchants, who hir'd him to drive his Oxen; by the help of which Diſguiſe he eſcap'd out of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Territories, and arriv'd ſafe at <hi>Lubeck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aſſoon as <hi>Banner</hi> heard of his Priſoner's Flight, he purſu'd him with extraordinary Haſte and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and overtook him at <hi>Lubeck.</hi> In the firſt Tranſports of his Anger he began to treat him as a Perſon, who by a baſe Action had expos'd his Friend and Benefactor to the Indignation of his Sovereign, and the Forfeiture of a conſiderable Summ of Money. <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> knowing that theſe Reproaches were not altogether groundleſs, was ſo far from being offended at 'em, that he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd in the mildeſt and moſt obliging Terms to pacifie his Kinſman, and to convince him of the Innocency, and even Neceſſity of that Action which he blam'd. He begg'd him to conſider cooly and impartially the Injuſtice of his Reſtraint, and the Injury that was done him againſt the public Faith, and the Law of Nations. He told him, that he himſelf was a Witneſs with what Patience and Submiſſion he had born his Impriſonment, ſo long as he cou'd entertain the leaſt Hope that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> might at laſt be perſwaded to do him Juſtice: and that no reaſonable Perſon cou'd blame him for endeavouring to procure his Liberty, ſince even the Treaty of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal</hi> cou'd not oblige his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemy to releaſe him. He added, that he wou'd never forget the obliging Treatment he had receiv'd at his Houſe; and that he wou'd
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62547:64"/>take care to ſend him the Summ which the King requir'd for his Ranſom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Banner</hi> was ſo fully convinc'd by his Reaſons, and ſatisfy'd with his Promiſe, that he went home and gave out that he cou'd not find his Priſoner. The King fearing that his old Enemy wou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to form a Party againſt him in <hi>Sweden,</hi> ſent Orders to General <hi>Otho</hi> to make a diligent Search for him. But notwithſtanding all the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that threaten'd him, he perſiſted in his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to return to <hi>Sweden,</hi> and to incite his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, to make a vigorous Effort to recover their Liberty. In purſuance of that Deſign he diſcover'd himſelf to <hi>Nicholas Gems,</hi> the firſt Conſul of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> and endeavour'd by ſeveral Reaſons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade that Magiſtrate to favor him with his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Aſſiſtance. He intreated him to conſider that 'twas the Intereſt of the Regency, to put a ſeaſonable Stop to the boundleſs Ambition of King <hi>Chriſtiern;</hi> that the Conqueſt of <hi>Sweden</hi> wou'd make that Prince Maſter of all the Trade of the <hi>Baltic</hi> Sea, and conſequently ruin the Merchants of the <hi>Hanſe</hi> Towns; and that the Inhabitants of <hi>Lubeck</hi> cou'd never reckon themſelves ſecure, while the three Northern Crowns were united in the Perſon of one Sovereign. Afterwards he put him in mind of the Hatred which the <hi>Danes</hi> had on all occaſions expreſs'd againſt that City; and of the many and important Services which the Republic had receiv'd from <hi>Sweden.</hi> He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he was confident the Regency had not yet forgotten, that they ow'd their Liberty to <hi>Eric Bleſus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who deliver'd 'em from the Tyrannical Uſurpation of <hi>Waldemar</hi> II.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1248"/> King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> and that their Merchants were oblig'd to the Trade and Protection of <hi>Sweden,</hi> for all the Riches they enjoy'd. And concluded, that he hop'd, that both Intereſt and Gratitude
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62547:64"/>wou'd prevail with the Re-publick to aſſiſt their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1519"/> Ancient Allies in the juſt Defence of their Liberty and Privileges.</p>
               <p>The Conſul was very ſenſible of the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Deſire, and promis'd to propoſe it at the firſt Meeting of the Council: But the Regency, who were all Merchants, did not think fit to declare for a Party that had no ſtanding Forces to ſupport 'em, and were not in a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to put themſelves in a Poſture of Defence. Theſe <hi>Burghers</hi> were only concern'd for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Security of their Trade, and they were ſo afraid of incurring the Diſpleaſure of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who was Maſter of a potent Fleet, that they refus'd to grant <hi>Guſtavus</hi> a Paſſage to <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi> where he was deſirous to make his firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. But it ſeems the Conſul ſaw further, or was better acquainted with the Intereſts of the City, than the reſt of the Council; or perhaps had private Orders to ſhow more favor to that illuſtrious Adventurer, than the Regency were willing to own: For he told him in ſecret, that he wou'd provide a Veſſel that ſhou'd carry him to <hi>Sweden;</hi> and at his Departure aſſur'd him, that if he cou'd form a Party ſtrong enough to take the Field, the Regency wou'd infallibly declare for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> wou'd have landed at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> but the Maſter of the Ship, either in Obedience to private Orders, or becauſe he was bound to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Place; ſet him aſhore near <hi>Calmar,</hi> which ſeem'd ſtill to adhere to the Party and Intereſt of the Princeſs <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> the Adminiſtrator's Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; or rather was kept by the Governor, till the <hi>Danes</hi> ſhou'd offer ſome advantageous Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal to make amends for the Loſs of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:62547:65"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> diſcover'd himſelf to the Governor, and to the principal Officers of the Garriſon, who were for the moſt part <hi>Germans,</hi> and had ſerv'd under him in Prince <hi>Steno</hi>'s Army; imagining that they wou'd have ſo much regard to his Birth, and former Authority, as to intruſt him with the Command of the Town. He exhorted 'em to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize their Courage in ſo noble a Cauſe, and to preſerve that Fidelity to the Princeſs, which they had promis'd to her deceaſt Husband: He told 'em that he had run thro' all Dangers, that he might have a ſhare in the Glory of a vigorous and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Defence; and aſſur'd 'em that they might confidently expect a ſpeedy and ſeaſonable Relief. But thoſe mercenary Foreigners, ſeeing that he had neither Troops nor ſo much as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to attend him, look'd upon him as a loſt Man, and were ſo far from ſubmitting to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or engaging in his Party, that when he attempted to gain ſome Soldiers of the Garriſon, they threaten'd ſo poſitively to kill him, or to deliver him up to King <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> that he was forc'd to prevent the Execution of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces by a ſpeedy Flight, and was even oblig'd to have recourſe to his former Diſguiſe, upon advice that the <hi>Danes</hi> who were advertis'd of his Arrival, had ſent out ſeveral Parties to apprehend him. And fearing leaſt ſo vigilant an Enemy might eaſily diſcover a young Lord in the Habit of a <hi>Peaſant,</hi> he hid himſelf in a Waggon laden with Straw, and in that Equipage paſs'd thro' all the Quarters of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Army, to a Caſtle that belong'd to his Father in the Province of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thence he wrote to his Friends, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint 'em with his Eſcape and Return, deſiring 'em to repair immediately to the Place where he lay with all their Vaſſals and Followers. For he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62547:65"/>hop'd that by their Aſſiſtance he might be able to force ſome Quarter of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Army, and afterwards to march to the Relief of <hi>Stockholm.</hi> But they were ſo far from engaging in ſo hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous a Deſign, that even his Relations refus'd to entertain any Correſpondence with him. That paſſionate Love, or rather fondneſs of Liberty, which was always reckon'd the peculiar Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the Nation, ſeem'd to be quite extinct, and the haughty and untractable <hi>Swedes</hi> became the tame Slaves of their moſt hated Enemies. Every Man endeavour'd to avoid the leaſt ſhadow of Suſpicion, and contented himſelf with ſecuring his private Intereſt, without regarding the Safety and Honor of his Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> diſdaining the Cowardiſe of his Friends, reſolv'd to have recourſe to the <hi>Peaſants,</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that 'twou'd be an eaſie Task to inflame the natural Fierceneſs of the Rabble, who cou'd neither be engag'd by Fear nor Hope in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Faction. He went about the neighboring Villages in the Night, endeavouring to gain the principal Perſons, and at laſt ventur'd to appear in Public on Feſtival-days, to incite the Mobile to take up Arms againſt their Oppreſſors. But he ſoon perceiv'd that their wonted Fury was but too effectually cool'd by the late diſaſtrous War, in which moſt of 'em had ſeen the Death of ſome of their Relations: And inſtead of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him their Aſſiſtance, they told him in a blunt and clowniſh Manner, that they wanted neither <hi>Herrings</hi> nor <hi>Salt</hi> under the Dominion of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> but cou'd not avoid certain Deſtruction, if they ſhou'd make the leaſt Attempt againſt ſo potent a Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was equally vex'd, and ſurpris'd at ſo unexpected a Diſappointment. He knew not what to do, for whither to retire: He cou'd not be ſafe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62547:66"/>in <hi>Sweden,</hi> but at the Head of an Army; the <hi>Danes</hi> were ſtill in queſt of him, and he cou'd neither continue long in one place, nor make frequent Removes without expoſing himſelf to manifeſt and even almoſt unavoidable Dangers. At laſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, tho' with the hazard of his Life, to get into <hi>Stockholm,</hi> hoping that his Preſence wou'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the <hi>Burghers,</hi> and Garriſon, with new Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Courage, and that by making a brave Defence, he might prevail with the <hi>Hanſe</hi> Towns, to ſend him a ſeaſonable Relief. He left the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Refnas,</hi> without acquainting any Perſon with his Deſign, and travell'd for ſome Days thro' By ways, ſpending the Night in ſolitary Cottages, to avoid meeting with his vigilant Purſuers. But notwithſtanding all his Caution, he was once in ſo great Danger of being ſurpriz'd, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my came but an Hour too late. So that finding it impoſſible to proceed on his Journey, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling into the Hands of the <hi>Danes,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd by another Road, and in ſo preſſing an Extremity, reſolv'd to take Sanctuary for ſome time in a Convent of <hi>Carthuſians</hi> at <hi>Griphyſolm,</hi> which was founded by his Anceſtors. But the Monks preferring their preſent Intereſt to the Memory of paſt Favors, refus'd to admit him, under pretext that they were afraid of expoſing their Houſe and Order, to the Fury and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Danes.</hi> And therefore perceiving that 'twou'd be in vain to expect a ſafe Retreat, where there was ſo little Appearance of Generoſity or Gratitude, he return'd to the Province of <hi>Suder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania,</hi> and retir'd to the Houſe of a <hi>Peaſant,</hi> that had been an old Servant in his Family, where he lay hid for ſome time, and ſent his Hoſt with Letters to ſeveral Lords, endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate their drooping Courage, and inſpire 'em with a noble Reſolution to recover their Liberty

In the mean time, <hi>Guſtavus</hi> comforted himſelf with the hope of ſome Revolution after that Prince's arrival, concluding that the ſeverity of his Government would rouſe the averſion of the <hi>Swedes</hi> againſt their ancient Enemies. King <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> long'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely to enjoy the Fruit of his Victories, and to awe his new Subjects with the ſight of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror.

The Archbiſhop eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thought himſelf oblig'd to ſignalize his zeal on this occaſion, and to expreſs a more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Satisfaction for the ſucceſs of a Revolution by which he hop'd to be the principal gainer: For he concluded that as ſoon as the King had compleated the Conqueſt of <hi>Sweden,</hi> he would entruſt him with the ſole management of his Authority.</p>
               <p>

               <p>But the Adminiſtrator's Widow expreſt a more Heroical Reſolution than that treacherous Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.

The Courage of that Princeſs and the boldneſs of her Anſwer was a ſufficient Intimation to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiern,</hi> that the Conqueſt of <hi>Stockholm</hi> wou'd coſt him dearer and require more ſubſtantial Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries than that of <hi>Calmar.</hi> And therefore ſince he perceiv'd that in all probability the Garriſon wou'd make an obſtinate Defence, he advanc'd with his Army to inveſt the Place, and order'd Admiral <hi>Norbi</hi> to block up the Port with his Fleet.</p>
               <p>He carry'd on the Siege with all the earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vigour that can be ſuppos'd to animate an Ambitious Prince, who is juſt upon the point of compleating the Conqueſt of a Kingdom. He was day and night on Horſe-back; he encourag'd his Souldiers both by his own Example, and by conſiderable Rewards; he went daily to the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and viſited the moſt advanc'd Works; he ſhar'd all the danger and fatigue of the Siege with the meaneſt of his Soldiers; and, which was ſtill a more difficult and laborious Task he curb'd the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous violence of his humour, diſſembled his ſecret and implacable averſion againſt the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Nation,

               <p>'Twas not without an extream Reluctancy, that the Princeſs condeſcended to hear ſo unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Meſſage.

               <p>He ſtood in need of all his Power, and of the Fame of his Conqueſts and Arms, to keep his Subjects from breaking out into open Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. The People encourag'd by his Abſence, and by the Neceſſity of his preſent Circumſtances, which oblig'd him to remove his Forces; obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refus'd to pay the new Taxes, which he had laid upon 'em. They were generally diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd, and complain'd againſt the Government; they blam'd him openly for invading <hi>Sweden,</hi> and gave out that his Army was beaten, tho' that Report was only grounded on their Wiſhes that it might prove true. The Senate, and principal Lords of the Kingdom were ſo far from oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſuppreſſing ſo viſible a Tendency to a Revolt, that they fomented the Diſcontent of the People. They hated <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> for excluding 'em from their wonted ſhare in the Government; and were incens'd even to Madneſs, becauſe he ſeem'd only to aſſume an Arbitrary Power, that he might lodge it entirely in the Hands of an old <hi>Dutch</hi> woman call'd <hi>Sigebrite,</hi> who had neither <hi>Birth</hi> nor <hi>Beauty</hi> to engage his Affection, and yet, meerly by her <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Cunning,</hi> had made him one of the moſt deſperate Lovers in the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62547:69"/>World. She govern'd him with an abſolute and uncontroul'd Empire; her Pleaſure was the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Law, on which the Fate of the Court, and of the whole Kingdom depended. 'Twas as impoſſible to undermine, as 'twas dangerous to oppoſe her Intereſt: She gave, and took away all Places, Offices, and Dignities as ſhe pleas'd, without reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The quick Return of that Monarch from his victorious Expedition ſurpriz'd his murmuring Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and broke all their Deſigns. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd with all poſſible Care to conceal their Diſcontent, and to expreſs a ſeeming Joy for their Prince's Succeſs. He was receiv'd at his Arrival with all thoſe Marks of Affection and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which are the perpetual Companions of the Fortunate. His Miniſters, according to the uſual Maxims of Courtiers, who are always ready to flatter, and comply with the Humour, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of their Sovereign, told him in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet-Council, that in purſuance of the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Rules of Policy, he ought to ſecure the principal Lords of <hi>Sweden;</hi> that he cou'd not hope to preſerve his Conqueſts, without aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Senate</hi> of that Kingdom, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as a Body of Factious Perſons, who upon all occaſions aſſum'd a Liberty to controul and oppoſe the Royal Authority; that there was not one Member of that Aſſembly, who wou'd not joyfully embrace the firſt Opportunity of a Revolt, to make himſelf Maſter of the Sovereign
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62547:69"/>Power under the Title of <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> which for ſeveral Years had been the Reward of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and Fomenters of a ſucceſsful Rebellion; that he ought to rid himſelf of the Senators, who were formidable to the Crown, by reaſon of the vaſtneſs of their Eſtates, and the Authority they had over the People; and that he ought only to leave ſuch Perſons in the Kingdom, whoſe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was curb'd by the meanneſs of their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and who cou'd not pretend to any higher Employment than Tilling the Ground, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tribute to their Sovereign.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Sigebrite</hi> made it her buſineſs to confirm the Opinion, and Advice of theſe flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Courtiers, by repreſenting to the King, that his Victory wou'd be imperfect, and the Conſequences of it doubtful and uncertain, while there were any Lords in the Kingdom, able or willing to diſpute the Lawfulneſs of his Title; that the Senators and the principal Noblemen were implacable Enemies to his Authority; that he ought to ſecure his Conqueſts, and compleat his Victory by the Death of thoſe who were in a Condition to oppoſe him; that to prevent all future Diſturbances, he ought not to ſpare even thoſe who were moſt zealous and active in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting his Intereſt; that the ſeeming Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Biſhops was only an Effect of the Ancient Emulation and Animoſity betwixt them and the Nobility; and that thoſe ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prelates wou'd prove the moſt dangerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, if he ſhou'd give 'em the leaſt occaſion to ſuſpect that he intended to curb their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or exclude 'em from a ſhare in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The inhumane Politics of this <hi>She-Favorite</hi> were extremely agreeable to the ſierce and cruel Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of a Prince, who look'd upon the Liberty
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62547:70"/>of his Subjects as inconſiſtent with his Honour and Safety. He imagin'd that his Authority was eſſentially annex'd to the Dignity of his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, without any Dependence upon the Laws of the Kingdom, and that his Will was the only Rule and Standard of his Government. Theſe were the Principles and Maxims by which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated his Actions; ſo that he was eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to Sacrifice the Senate, and moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Noblemen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to the Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Ambition, and to ſecure his Conqueſts by the Death of ſo many illuſtrious Victims. But he wanted a ſpecious Pretext to juſtifie, or at leaſt to excuſe ſo barbarous an Attempt; for he durſt not without a plauſible Shew of Reaſon proceed to the Execution of ſo many Perſons of Quality, who had voluntarily ſubmitted to him, and rely'd upon the Faith of a ſolemn Treaty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sigebrite</hi> advis'd him to commit the Execution of that inhumane Sentence to the Officers of the Garriſon of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> who, under the Pretext of a Quarrel betwixt the Soldiers and Inhabitants of the City, might encourage the former to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute their Revenge, by an Univerſal Maſſacre of all the Perſons of Note in the Town. But notwithſtanding the natural Impetuoſity of his Temper, he was loath to venture upon an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that was clogg'd with ſo many Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and might probably be attended with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and fatal Conſequences: He conſider'd that the Burghers of that City were numerous, and inur'd to War by the late Siege which they had ſuſtain'd; that the Garriſon might be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd, and cut to pieces in the Heat of the Tumult; and that the Succeſs of their Reſiſtance might ſerve as a Signal for a Revolt thro' the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:62547:70"/>
               <p>For theſe Reaſons he choſe rather to make uſe of the Pretext of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and of the pretended Injuſtice that was done to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, that the People might be deluded by a certain Appearance of Uniformity, and coherency in all his Proceedings, and that he might ſeem to be acted only by a ſtedfaſt Zeal for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Pope's Bull againſt the Enemies of that Prelate. He ſpent ſome Time in <hi>Denmark,</hi> in contriving the moſt probable Meaſures, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neceſſary Orders to prevent the Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that might happen in his Abſence; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Departure disbanded the <hi>French</hi> Troops that were in his Service. This was probably an Effect of his Complaiſance to his Brother-in-Law,

                  <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who not long before had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Imperial Dignity; for the Soldiers were not only diſmiſs'd with all the Marks of Contempt and Diſreſpect, but treated rather as Priſoners of War, than as Allies, and Auxiliary Forces, to whoſe Valour he ow'd the beſt Part of his Conqueſts. They cou'd neither obtain the Payment of their Arrears, nor a Supply of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Proviſions; nor wou'd he furniſh 'em with Ships to tranſport 'em to their own Country; ſo that they were forc'd to wander about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, like a Company of ſtragling Vagabonds. Many of 'em were ſtarv'd to Death, others were Maſſacr'd by the <hi>Danes,</hi> ſome were conſtrain'd to liſt themſelves in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Service, and their Officers were oblig'd to encounter with a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Difficulties in bringing home the Reſt.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as the King had order'd his Affairs in <hi>Denmark,</hi> he prepar'd for his Departure to <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> that he might be preſent at the Convention of the Eſtates, which he had call'd in Order to performing of the Ceremony of his Coronation. <hi>Sigebrite</hi> advis'd him to carry Two <hi>Daniſh</hi> Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

               <p>'Twas by her Advice that he made Choice of <hi>Theodore</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Lunden,</hi> and Primate of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Odenſee,</hi> one of his Suffragans; the ſame to whom he had formerly procur'd the Bull of Excommunication to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, which Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth publiſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Adminiſtrator. They were intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the Court, and were only reſpected as the Miniſters of the King's irregular Paſſions. He plac'd a great deal of Confidence in the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Lunden,</hi> who was a Perſon of mean Birth, and cou'd neither be reckon'd a <hi>Scholar</hi> nor a <hi>Stateſman;</hi> but to make amends for theſe Defects, he was a moſt ingenious Contriver of new and refin'd Pleaſures, and admirably well acquainted with all the Secrets and Improvements of that myſterious Art. He ow'd his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Favor of his Maſter to <hi>Sigchritc,</hi> who firſt brought him to Court to ſerve her in the Quality of a Spy, and afterwards rais'd him from the mean Office of the King's <hi>Barber,</hi> to the Dignity of <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Lunden.</hi> And as he had the good Fortune to be ſupported by ſo powerful a Benefactreſs, he quickly became the Favorite and Confident of his Maſter, by furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with a conſtant Supply of freſh and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſify'd Pleaſures.</p>
               <p>The King ſet Sail for <hi>Sweden,</hi> accompany'd with the Queen his Wife, and attended by all the Court. But <hi>Sigebrite</hi> declin'd the Voyage, either becauſe ſhe was unwilling to expoſe her ſelf to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrical Mirth of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Lords, who were oftentimes wont to make the King's extravagant

               <p>At his Arrival in <hi>Sweden,</hi> he receiv'd an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador from the Emperor, who came to inveſt him with the Order of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> and to congratulate his Victories, and the happy Succeſs of all his Deſigns. The Concern which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror expreſs'd for promoting the Intereſt of his Brother-in-Law, was too warm and zealous to be reckon'd meerly an Effect of their <hi>Affinity,</hi> which ſeldom or never produces ſo ſtrong an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection among <hi>Sovereigns.</hi> 'Tis thought that aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Prince beſtow'd his Siſter upon the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> on Condition that he ſhou'd declare him to be his Succeſſor in the three Kingdoms of the <hi>North,</hi> in Caſe he ſhou'd die without Iſſue.

And the ſame Fondneſs for that imaginary Scheme ſeems to have been entail'd upon his Family and Succeſſors, till the Terror and Rapidity of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Conqueſts, and the fortunate Valor of their Royal Leader, rous'd the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II. out of his Golden Dream,

The Reſult of their Conſultations was, that the Archbiſhop ſhou'd appear in the Convention, and preſent an Addreſs to the King, demanding Juſtice againſt thoſe who depriv'd him of his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Eſtate. Matters being thus concerted, the King open'd the Meeting of the Eſtates, where he was ſolemnly acknowledg'd as the lawful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of <hi>Sweden.</hi> The next Day the Archbiſhop perſorm'd the Ceremony of his Coronation;

               <p>Afterwards, the new King invited all the Lords to a magnificent Feaſt, which he had order'd to be prepar'd in the Caſtle, as a public Mark of his Joy upon the Occaſion of his Acceſſion to the Crown.

               <p>The Princeſs perceiving that the King was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, and that ſhe muſt reſolve to defend the Actions of the Prince her Husband, anſwer'd at laſt with a great deal of Courage, that the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator</hi> beſieg'd the Arch-Biſhop, and demoliſh'd his Caſtle by virtue of expreſs Order from the <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Senate</hi> of the Kingdom; that the Arch-Biſhop was arraign'd and convicted of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt his Country, according to the uſual Forms of proceeding in ſuch Caſes that were preſcrib'd by the Laws of the Nation; and that his Sentence was ſtill extant in the Public Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters, ſign'd by all the Senators both Secular and Eccleſiaſtical.</p>

               <p>The Nobility terrify'd with ſo many Maſſacres, and not well united among themſelves, deſtitute of a Head, Money and Forces, were oblig'd to avoid the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Cruelty, to ſubmit to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop: So that every one ſtrove to court this Prelate, and every one wou'd be thought to have done it always.

                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> during his retreat look'd about him on all ſides to ſee if he could diſcover any thing that might favour his deſigns; he had privately ſent to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> that old Servant at whoſe houſe he lay conceal'd, to inform him of the Occurences of the State. And at his return it was that he heard of the Death of his Father and all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, and the general Maſſacre that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in that miſerable City; this ſo lamentable a piece of news did extreamly afflict him, the Death of ſo many Lords, having taken off all his Family and Friends, and almoſt depriv'd him of all means and hopes of ſaving himſelf.

So that he durſt not ſtir from the place he was in, nor truſt any of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> leſt the great rewards ſhou'd make 'em betray him. He reſolv'd in this exigence privately to retreat to the Mountains of <hi>Dalecarlia,</hi> hoping he might eaſily lye hid in the Woods with which that Country is cover'd, and imagin'd that it would not be difficult to cauſe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62547:77"/>the Inhabitants to Revolt, being the laſt of the Kingdom that ſubmitted to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Dominion. There was not one good Town in the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and hardly any but ſmall Villages Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the edges of the Foreſts, or on the banks of Lakes and Rivers, ſome of theſe Villages de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the Gentlemen of the Country, but moſt belong'd to the Crown and were Govern'd by the <hi>Peaſants</hi> themſelves; the Elders in every Village ſupply'd the place of Judges and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, tho' theſe were neither more Powerful nor Richer than their Neighbours; the Honour of Commander conſiſting only in the priviledge of Fighting at the head of the Troops; for the chief Power was in the hands of the Multitude, who Aſſembl'd on holydays, and took upon them to determine all manner of Affairs.</p>
               <p>The Government durſt not ſend either Troops or Garriſons into this Province, nor did the Kings themſelves ever enter it, till they had given pledges to the Inhabitants for maintaining their Priveledges; they manag'd with caution this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage People who inhabited in inacceſſiable Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, leſt they ſhou'd diſcover that it was in their power no longer to obey, and were contented with the Tribute of a few skins only from theſe <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants,</hi> and for the reſt, they were ſuffer'd to Live according to their own particular Cuſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That then the Peaſants wou'd be oblig'd to take up Arms in their own Defence; that he was reſolv'd to let others begin the Revolt, and wou'd neither envy the Glory nor Danger of ſo raſh an undertaking. He conjur'd him to wait patiently at his Houſe till the People ſhou'd appear in Arms; inſinuating that wherever the Revolt ſhou'd begin, the leading men of the Party wou'd always be ready to yield him that ſubmiſſion which they ow'd to his birth and merit; And concluded with adviſing him not to ruin ſo generous deſign by a prepoſterous haſte in the execution of it; leaſt, inſtead of becoming the Avenger and Deliverer of his Countrey, he ſhou'd only furniſh the <hi>Danes</hi> with a new pretext to com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pleat the Deſtruction of the Nation.</p>

He was ſo far from ſuſpecting that he was a ſecret Well-wiſher to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Intereſt, or that he was capable of betraying his Gueſt, that he did him the juſtice to believe the ſincerity of his Affection to his Countrey: but at the ſame time he perceiv'd that the difficulty of the Attempt deterr'd him from engaging in it. And therefore inſtead of reproaching him with Cowardice and Puſillanimity, he contented himſelf with conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to keep the ſecret with which he had entruſted him; and reſolv'd upon a ſpeedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture to free his timorous Landlord of the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Uneaſineſs which he might ſuffer upon his account. He ſet out alone, and in the night, to avoid ſuſpicion, and after ſeveral days Journey thro' the Woods arriv'd at the ſeat of another Gentleman, call'd <hi>Peterſon,</hi> whom he knew in the Army, and who, he hop'd wou'd receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his Propoſals with more Courage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peterſon</hi> receiv'd him with all the marks of an obliging Civility; and entertain'd him with that reſpect and ſubmiſſion which is uſally ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to great Perſons when they are under a Cloud. He ſeem'd to be more ſenſibly afflicted with his misfortunes than <hi>Guſtavus</hi> himſelf: he exclaim'd againſt the Tyranny of the <hi>Danes;</hi> and cheerfully embrac'd the firſt propoſal which <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtavus</hi> made to him, ſome days after his arrival, to form a Party, and engage all his Vaſſals and Followers in the Deſign.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:62547:80"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was extremely glad that he had at laſt found a man who was not afraid to draw his ſword in the defence of his Countrey; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor'd by all the moſt winning Expreſſions of Kindneſs, and by the ſure propect of a ſutable Recompence to confirm him in ſo generous a Reſolution. <hi>Peterſon</hi> anſwer'd him with repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aſſurances of an inviolable Fidelity: he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd the Gentlemen and the chief Perſons among the Peaſants whom he hop'd to engage in the Attempt: and ſome days after he went privately from his houſe, in order, as he pretended, to put the deſign in Execution.</p>
               <p>But under the ſpecious pretext of a zealous Affection to <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> the treacherous <hi>Dalecarlian</hi> was contriving his Ruine. The hope of making his Court to the new King, and the Expectation of a large reward, made him reſolve to ſacrifice his Honor to his Ambition, and to violate the moſt ſacred Laws of Hoſpitality by betraying his Illuſtrious Gueſt. In purſuance of that baſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution he went ſtraight to one of King <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiern</hi>'s Officers, and inform'd him that <hi>Guſtavus</hi> lay conceal'd at his Houſe. The <hi>Daniſh</hi> Officer march'd thither immediately at the head of a Party of Soldiers: he inveſted the Houſe, and took poſſeſſion of the Principal Gate which <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſon</hi> deliver'd up to him. He concluded that he had done his Maſter a very important and acceptable piece of ſervice, by ſecuring his moſt terrible Enemy. But he had the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to find that he had taken a great deal of pains to no purpoſe: For <hi>Guſtavus</hi> had made his Eſcape the Night before, and even ow'd his Preſervation to the Wife of the Traitor that deſign'd to betray him. She was prompted by Pity, and perhaps by a more tender Paſſion, to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62547:81"/>diſcover her Husband's Plot, and not only ſent <hi>Guſtavus</hi> away in the Night, but order d a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in whom ſhe plac'd a more than ordinary Confidence to carry him to the Houſe of a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, who was one of her Friends. Thus by the Kindneſs and Diſcretion of that generous Lady, and by the Secrecy of her faithful Servant, <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtavus</hi> eſcap'd the Snare that was laid for him, and avoided the Purſuit of his Enemies, who cou'd neither diſcover the Occaſion of his Flight, nor the place whither he retir'd.</p>
               <p>The Curate receiv'd him with all the Civility and Reſpect which he ow'd to his Birth, and to the Recommendation of the Perſon that entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted him with ſo important a Secret. He was a ſincere lover of his Country, and did not think himſelf oblig'd to follow the Maxims of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, ſince he had no deſign to raiſe his Fortune by aſpiring to higher Preferment. He aſſur'd <hi>Guſtaevus</hi> of an inviolable Secrecy, and leaſt the Place of his abode ſhou'd be diſcover'd by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, or Indiſcretion of the Servant that brought him thither, he carry'd him to his Church, and hid him in a Place that was wholly at his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and of which he alone kept the Keys.</p>
               <p>He viſited him every Day, and by degrees began to feel a ſecret and reſiſtleſs Inclination to love and eſteem him; which was the uſual Effect of the Preſence and Converſation of that young Lord. Nor did the generous Curate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with expreſſing his Affection to <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtavus</hi>'s Perſon; he approv'd his Reſolution, and encourag'd him to undertake the great Attempt, aſſuring him that he wou'd employ all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Village, and engage all his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances in other Places, to carry on the Deſign with the utmoſt Vigor and Diligence. But at the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62547:81"/>ſame time he acknowledg'd that he cou'd neither adviſe him to deſire the Aſſiſtance, nor rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fidelity of the <hi>Dalecarlian</hi> Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>He inform'd him that the Nobility and Gentry of that Province, contented themſelves with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Enjoyment of their Eſtates, and the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Authority they aſſum'd in their inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Mountains; that they neither thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concern'd in the Motions and Revolutions of the Court, nor regarded the public Intereſt of the Nation; that they were ſeldom willing, and ſometimes unable to make their Vaſſals take up Arms; and that they wou'd hardly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to engage in a War, ſince it either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd 'em of their principal Riches, which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the Number of their Followers, or made the <hi>Peaſants</hi> leſs tractable after their Return, and more apt to revolt againſt their Maſters. And therefore he concluded, that 'twou'd be his beſt and ſafeſt Method, to apply himſelf immediately to the <hi>Peaſants,</hi> aſſuring him that he might expect a more vigorous and effectual Aſſiſtance from 'em, if they ſhou'd take up Arms, and declare for him of their own accord, than if the Villages were only engag'd by the Authority of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Lords.</p>
               <p>After they had conſulted together about the moſt proper Expedients, to put their Deſign in Execution, they agreed that 'twou'd be highly conducive to the Succeſs of the intended Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, to prepoſſeſs the minds of the <hi>Peaſants,</hi> and prepare 'em for an Inſurrection, by giving out that the <hi>Danes</hi> were juſt ready to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Province to levy new Taxes and Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Curate undertook to ſpread the Report, and aſſur'd <hi>Guſtavus</hi> that he wou'd ſhortly make it the Publick News of the Country, by the joint
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62547:82"/>Aſſiſtance of the reſt of the Curates in that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict, who for the moſt part were either his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations or Correſpondents. Afterwards he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd him to go to <hi>Mora,</hi> a populous Dioceſs or Pariſh, about Twelve <hi>Swediſh</hi> Leagues in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs; where every Year during the <hi>Chriſtmaſs-Holy-days</hi> there was an extraordinary Concourſe of <hi>Peaſants,</hi> from all the neighboring Villages. He told him that he cou'd neither expect nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a more favorable Opportunity to propoſe his Deſign to the <hi>Peaſants,</hi> who were never bolder, nor more eaſily perſwaded to revolt than in ſuch Public Aſſemblies, where they have a full View of their Numbers and Strength. And in the mean time he promis'd to ſecure and engage the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and leading Perſons that he might not be in any Danger, who' the Croud ſhou'd reject his Propoſals.</p>
               <p>In purſuance of the Curate's advice, <hi>Guſtavus</hi> went to <hi>Mora</hi> on the day appointed, where he found the Peaſants already acquainted with his deſign to make 'em a viſit, and expecting with impatience to ſee a Man of whoſe merit and valor they had receiv'd ſo advantageous a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, one that was equally illuſtrious both for his Birth and Courage, and had acquir'd more Glory by <hi>Chriſtiern</hi>'s hatred than by the Favor of <hi>Steno.</hi> He laid aſide his uſual Habit, and took care that his Dreſs ſhou'd be ſutable to his Quality, to engage the attention of the People, who are apt to be dazzl'd with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal marks of Grandeur. Afterwards he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the Aſſembly with a certain Noble Fierceneſs in his Air, which was ſomewhat allay d and ſoften'd by a mixture of Tenderneſs and Grief for the Death of his Father and all the reſt of the Senate. And that Majeſtic ſorrow, which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62547:82"/>the admiring Multitude obſerv'd in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and actions, inpir'd 'em at the ſame time with a ſubmiſſive reſpect and a tender and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Compaſſion.</p>
               <p>After he had entertain'd 'em with a general but lively deſcription of the deplorable and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt hopeleſs condition of their native Countrey; he repreſented to 'em, with a pathetic and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Eloquence, that the Senators and principal Lords of the Kingdom were Barbarouſly Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred by <hi>Chriſtern</hi>'s Order; that by the ſame Prince's Command the Magiſtrates of <hi>Stockholm</hi> were put to Death and the greateſt part of the Citizens Murder'd in their Houſes; that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he diſpers'd his Army into the ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, that they might the ſooner compleat the Deſtruction of the Kingdom; that he was reſolv'd to ſecure his Authority by the Death of all thoſe, whether Noble, or Ignoble, who were either able or willing to undertake the Defence of their Country; that he was particularly incens'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Dalecarlians,</hi> whoſe Valor and Courage had made him tremble ſo often during the Reign of the late Adminiſtrator; that conſequently they had all the reaſon in the World to expect the moſt inhumane Treatment from a treacherous and cruel Prince, that wou'd never forgive 'em ſo long as he dreaded their Bravery; that under pretext of putting his Army into Winter-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he was actually ſending his Troops to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm 'em; that they wou'd quickly be expos'd to the Fury of enrag'd Soldiers; that their Lives and Liberty wou'd be at the Diſpoſal of their inſolent and mercileſs Enemies; and that the only way to prevent their impending Ruine, was to reſolve upon a vigorous and ſeaſonable Reſiſtance. That the <hi>Dalecarlians</hi> had always
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62547:83"/>look'd upon <hi>Liberty,</hi> as a dearer and more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Bleſſing than <hi>Life;</hi> that the Eyes of the whole Nation were ſixt upon 'em in ſo critical a Juncture; that the World expected to ſee a convincing Proof, that they inherited the Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Heroical Anceſtors, and the noble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution with which thoſe Illuſtrious Patrio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> had always oppos'd the pretended Authority of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Uſurpers; that he was ready to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his Life and Fortune in the Defence of their Liberty; that his Friends and all true <hi>Swedes,</hi> wou'd join in ſo glorious an Attempt; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he had receiv'd poſitive Aſſurances of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Reinforcement of the ancient Allies o <hi>Sweden,</hi> but ſuppoſing that their Forces were not equal in number to thoſe of the <hi>Danes,</hi> Revenge and Self-preſervation wou'd inſpire 'em with a generous Fury, which wou'd eaſily ſupply that Defect; and that for his part, he wou'd rather chuſe to die, with his Sword in his hand, than to preſerve his Life by a baſe Submiſſion to a perfidious and cruel Enemy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dalecarlians</hi> anſwer'd this Diſcourſe with Shouts and Exclamations, threatening to exeaute their juſt Revenge upon <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> and the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Nation: One wou'd have thought that this had been the firſt time they heard of the Maſſacre of <hi>Stockholm;</hi> the Diſcourſe and Preſence of <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtavus,</hi> had made ſo deep an Impreſſion of Grief and Reſentment upon their Minds. They ſwore to revenge the Death of their Country-men, and immediately reſolv'd to diſown <hi>Chriſtiern</hi>'s Authority, and to deſtroy all the <hi>Danes</hi> they ſhou'd meet, without Mercy. Not but that ſome of theſe <hi>Peaſants</hi> were at firſt inclin'd to oppoſe this Revolt, under the Pretext of communicating their Deſigns to the other Villages; either becauſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62547:83"/>they were gain'd by the <hi>Danes,</hi> or upon a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Account were afraid of exaſperating a potent and victorious Prince. But the enrag'd Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude rejected this cowardly Motion with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſo that the moſt violent, and thoſe that declar'd for the War, were hearken'd to with a general Applauſe. Thus they unanimouſly took up Arms, and entreated <hi>Guſtavus</hi> to command 'em, being charm'd with his graceful Mien, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the Largeneſs of his Stature, and the ſtrong Conſtitution of his Body.</p>
               <p>But nothing confirm'd 'em more in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution they had taken to follow that young Lord, with a full aſſurance, than an obſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rvation made by the ancient Inhabitants of the Village, that the North-wind continu'd to blow inceſſantly while he made his Speech to 'em. This Accident among thoſe ſuperſtitious People, was look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as an infallible Sign of proſperous Succeſs, and therefore without any further Deliberation, imagining that the matter cou'd be no longer deferr'd without oppoſing the Orders of Heaven, which had ſo manifeſtly declar'd in favour of <hi>Guſtavus;</hi> they immediately form'd a Body of four hundred Men, and out of that Number choſe ſixteen of the handſomeſt and beſt ſhap'd Men that were deſcended of the principal Families, whom they preſented to <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> to attend upon his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as Life-guards, and to ſerve as a Mark of Badge of the Authority, which they had ſo lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> reſolving to take advantage of their Heat and Eagerneſs, lead 'em directly againſt the Governour of the Province; for 'twas his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to prevent that Officer, and to make him incapable of oppoſing the Revolt of the other Villages: In purſuance of that Reſolution, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62547:84"/>his Troop into ſeveral Bands, the better to conceal his March and Deſign, and under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of the Night and the Woods, arriv'd at the Foot of the Caſtle, with the <hi>Dalecarlians,</hi> who march'd thither ſecretly by different Roads. The Darkneſs of the Night, and the Surprize of ſo unexpected an Attack, favour'd his Attempt, ſo that the Caſtle was taken by <hi>Scalade,</hi> ſome <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Soldiers that compos'd the Governour's Guard, and the moſt part of his Domeſtick Servants, who ſtood in his Defence were immediately ſacrific'd to the Rage of the <hi>Dalecarlians;</hi> and <hi>Guſtavus</hi> had much ado to reſcue the Governour, who by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment ſuffer'd for his Imprudence in preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to maintain a Poſt in a conquer'd Country, and amidſt ſo fierce a Nation, without a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n ſufficient for the ſecurity of his Perſon and Dignity. <hi>Guſtavus</hi> permitted his Soldiers to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Governour's Apartment, and ſeveral <hi>Daniſh</hi> Merchants were treated almoſt after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who ſince <hi>Chriſtiern</hi>'s new Government came to trade in that Province; ſo that their richeſt Stuffs became a Prey to the <hi>Dalecarlian Peaſants,</hi> who dreſs'd themſelves with 'em after their odd Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They alſo kill'd the Officers that were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in levying the new Taxes, which <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> had impos'd. <hi>Guſtavus</hi> ſeem'd to take no notice of their Proceedings, and perhaps was not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at theſe diſorders, which ſerv'd only to make the breach between the <hi>Dalecarlians</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and their mutual Hatred more irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Tho' this Enterprize was not very conſiderable in it ſelf, it tended to confirm the <hi>Peaſants</hi> in their good Opinion of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> and they gave him Commendations ſo much the more willingly, becauſe they took him for a Witneſs of the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62547:84"/>and Bravery they ſhew'd on this Occaſion. The Report and Succeſs of this Expedition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few dayes caus'd almoſt the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to declare in his Favour, for the <hi>Peaſants</hi> came flocking from their Villages to joyn his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſome by reaſon of their eager and impatient deſire to be avenged on the <hi>Danes,</hi> while others were excited by the hope of getting Booty, or by their natural Inclination to undertake bold and deſperate Enterprizes.</p>
               <p>Many <hi>Swediſh</hi> Gentlemen and among others <hi>Olai, Lawrence Erici, Fredage</hi> and <hi>Jonas</hi> of <hi>Neder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> who were Outlaw'd by <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> and had fled for Refuge to that Province, repair'd to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as it were to a common Sanctuary. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed 'em in the Quality of Officers, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand theſe Tumultuary Forces who uſually fought with greater Impetuoſity than Order. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he travers'd with extraordinary Diligence, <hi>Helſingland, Medelpadia, Angermania, Geſtricia</hi> and <hi>Bothnia,</hi> caus'd all theſe ſmall Provinces to Revolt which are for the moſt part deſtitute of conſiderable Towns, and ſecur'd 'em by the good Order he took in fortifying the Paſſages of the Mountains, which are the Principal Forts of thoſe Countries.</p>
               <p>His Army was daily encreas'd in his march by the concourſe of the <hi>Peaſants,</hi> who came over to him in Crowd's, and oftentimes in ſpite of their Reſpective Lords: He aboliſh'd the Taxes which <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> had laid upon the People, and eſtabliſh'd Commiſſaries to receive the ordinary Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whch he appropriated for the ſubſiſtence of his Forces. Afterwards he diſpatch'd private E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries thro the whole Kingdom, to diſpoſe the Nobility and <hi>Peaſants</hi> to appear in Arms as ſoon as he ſhou'd enter into their Provinces. He
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62547:85"/>alſo gain'd by ſecret Negociations the greater part of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Officers that ſerv'd in <hi>Norby</hi>'s Fleet or in the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>'s Army: He left no means uneſſay'd that might ſerve to augment his Forces and diminiſh thoſe of his Enemy, and did not make Preparations to enter into the Heart of the Kingdom, till he thought himſelf almoſt as ſure of the Fidelity of all the <hi>Swedes</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in the Army of that Prelate, as of the Zeal of the <hi>Delecarlians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> made it his principal and almoſt only care to heap up Money which he ſpent in gratifying his Voluptuouſneſs; he aſpir'd only to this Dignity in hopes of finding means to Pillage thoſe People whom his Maſter deſign'd to Weaken and Ruin, and he would never have undertaken the Adminiſtration of the Government, if he had foreſeen that he ſhou'd have had to do with other Enemies then diſarmed People, that were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend themſelves: The Revolt of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecarlians</hi> was a very Surprizing and Mortifying piece of News to him, the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Forces that were left in the Kingdom were very much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd for want of Diſcipline and by Deſertion; he ſuſpected the Fidelity of the <hi>Swedes</hi> who had declar'd for him or were employ'd in his Army; nor did he place much Confidence in the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Auxiliary and Foreign Troops, who for the moſt part in Civil Wars are alwayes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to change their Maſters, when they meet with more advantageous Propoſals. The Valour of <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was formidable to him, he dreaded the Courage and Reſentment of that Young Lord; but he was yet more afraid of <hi>Chriſtiern</hi>'s Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as being a Prince whoſe Diſpleaſure was extremely terrible, and who uſually puniſh'd the Unfortunate, with as much ſeverity as the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:62547:85"/>
               <p>He diſpatch'd a Courier to that Prince to give him an Account of the Revolt of the Northern Provinces, and at the ſame time recall'd thoſe Troops that were diſpers'd in different parts of the Kingdom. The <hi>Danes</hi> obey'd their Orders, tho not without a ſecret Reluctancy to leave thoſe Places, where they enrich'd themſelves at the People's coſt, and committed all manner of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders with Impunity. But the greater part of the Auxiliary Forces refus'd to take the Field under pretext of the want of their Pay. They made themſelves Maſters of the Towns and Caſtles, where they were in Garriſon, and ſhut themſelves up in thoſe Places, not ſo much to defend and keep 'em for the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> as on purpoſe to retain 'em as Pledges for the payment of their Arrears; and to obtain more advantageous Terms from the Victorious Party.</p>
               <p>It was with no ſmall Trouble and Vexation that <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> heard of the Tranſactions in <hi>Sweden;</hi> he did not find himſelf in a condition to go into that Kingdom, and cou'd not ſpare the Forces he had in <hi>Denmark.</hi> The whole Realm was full of Diſaffected Perſons, for that Prince who was grown more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el fince the Maſſacre at <hi>Stockholm</hi> obſerv'd no Meaſures with his Subjects; he indifferently exercis'd his Authority on the Lives and Eſtates of the <hi>Danes,</hi> without any reſpect to the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Perſons, or to the Laws and Priviledges of the Country; he had caus'd ſeveral Gentlemen to be put to death without any Formality, and on very weak Surmiſes, and he had no leſs offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Biſhops and the whole body of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy by the Praiſes he publickly beſtow'd on <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> who under colour of blaming the Abuſes that were committed in <hi>Germany</hi> in the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Indulgences openly Condemn'd the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62547:86"/>Wealth which the Biſhops enjoy'd and the Temporal Power they aſſum'd.</p>
               <p>The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> uſually employ'd the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine Fryars</hi> to publiſh Indulgences in <hi>Saxony,</hi> by which they reap'd no ſmall profit, and which procur'd 'em a great Authority in that Country. The <hi>Jacobins</hi> under the Pontificate of <hi>Leo</hi> the X. got this Commiſſion from 'em: Theſe <hi>Monks</hi> to ſhew their Zeal in this new employment, and perhaps to inhance the income of their Miſſion, cry'd up in their Sermons the vertues and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Indulgences, in which they us'd certain Expreſſions that were not at all agreeable either to the deſign of the Church, or to the intent of the Bull that Authoriz'd 'em. Beſides, theſe Collectors led a Life not over Regular; 'tis ſaid they kept their Offices in Taverns, and often ſpent there in Feaſting what was the product of the people's Zeal, and what good mens Devotion made em ſpare even from their neceſſary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> of the Order of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Doctor and Profeſſor in the Univerſity of <hi>Witem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> pretended to be mov'd with theſe diſorders, but in reality deſirous to revenge his Brethren, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in his Sermons to fly out into ſharp invectives againſt the bad uſe theſe Collectors made of their Authority. He was a great Scholar and an Eloquent Orator, haſty, daring and headſtrong, conceited with his own Learning and Sentiments, and over fond of that glory which is acquir'd by broaching new Opinions; undaunted, and ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate as never to retract what he had once af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd. He contenttd himfelf at firſt with preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the unedifying manner of beſtowing theſe extraordinary Favours; but exaſperated by the Affronts and Threats of the <hi>Jacobins</hi> he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62547:86"/>back as far as the firſt Original of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</p>
               <p>He propoſed new Doctrines on the Subject of Iuſtification, of Remiſſion of ſins, of Penance and Purgatory, and at laſt ſpoke againſt the Popes Authority, from whence his adverſaries derived, the proofs by which they wou'd eſtabliſh Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</p>
               <p>He taught in his Wiritings and Preached in his Sermons, that we are juſtified by Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th alone, that Penance conſiſted only in a ſincere Contrition, and that Confeſſion was but an unprofitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of our Faults; that to obtain Remiſſion of ſins, 'twas ſufficient to believe with a Lively Faith, that they were forgiven; that Indulgences were neither recommended nor ordained to us for our practices, and that they were equally uſeleſs in this World, and in the next; that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory was but a Modern invention contrived by the Monks to cheat People out of their money; that the Maſs was no Sacrifice, that it was of no benefit to the dead, that that, and all other Prayers of the Church were to be Read in the vulgar tongue; and above all that the Holy Sacrament was to be Adminiſtred to the Faithful in both kinds.</p>
               <p>The Pope allarm'd by this new Doctrine, which ſeemed to expoſe the nature and extent of his Power to the cenſure and examination of every particular Perſon, thought to ſtifle ſo dangerous a Doctrine by condemning <hi>Luther</hi> as a Heretick, and even ordered <hi>Jerom Alexander</hi> his <hi>Nuntio</hi> to Solicit the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> to deliver up the Seditious Monk, that he might puniſh him as an Enemy to Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> to ſecure himſelf againſt the practices of that Court, and to engage the Duke of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:62547:87"/>and all Secular Magiſtrates to protect him, publiſh'd ſome new Writings as much in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Pope's Power as they were fovoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Sovereign Princes; he wrote againſt the Celibacy of the Prieſts and the Monachal vows; he taught that the only vows that were obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, were thoſe of Baptiſm; he inveigh'd againſt Hierarchy, which he pretended was a Tyrannical Government; he exclaim'd againſt the corruption of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and againſt the exceſſive Riches of the Church; he adviſed in his Books and Sermons all the Sovereign Princes to take poſſeſſion of the Funds and Revenues of the Biſhopricks, Abbys and Monaſteries, unleſs when there was a Sovereignty annexed to the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, and in that caſe, he wou'd have the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop marry, and not ſuffer ſuch Perſons, as under the ſpecious pretence of Celibacy ingag'd their Allegiance to a Foreign Power to remain in his Territories; he wou'd have the Monaſteries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into publick Schools and Hoſpitals, and the great Treatures thoſe Houſes enjoy'd to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd partly in maintaining the Preachers, Overſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and other Officers who ſhould take care of the Poor, and partly by the Prince in ſupplying the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igences of the State and the Neceſſities of his People.</p>
               <p>Theſe laſt Opinions gain'd <hi>Luther</hi> more Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then the firſt Propoſitions he had advanc'd, on the obſcure and crabbed Doctrine of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of the merit of good Works. Many <hi>German</hi> Princes under colour of this Doctrine, depriv'd the Church of ſeveral Lands and Eſtates which they thought lay convenient for 'em: And the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> after their Example uſurp'd part of the Demeans of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lunden,</hi> as if he had already declar'd openly for the new Religion.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:62547:87"/>
               <p>The <hi>Daniſh</hi> Clergy, to be reveng'd for the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front they met with under his Reign, and perhaps to diſpoſe People to a Rebellion, gave out a Prophecy of S. <hi>Bridget,</hi> to this effect, That a King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſhould be expell'd out of his Kingdom, becauſe of his Barbarity. Every one took Pleaſure in applying this to <hi>Chriſtiern;</hi> but he having heard of it, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly made a Jeſt of it; telling his Courtiers, That that Bigot, wrote every Morning the Dreams ſhe had had over Night, which ſhe very piouſly took for Revelations, and affecting to make that Saint the ſubject of his Mirth, either out of a Spirit of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſm, or, which is more probable, to diſcredit by a ſeeming Contempt and Deriſion, a Prediction which whether true or falſe, might make a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Impreſſion in Peoples Minds.</p>
               <p>However, ſince by reaſon of the general Diſcontent of all his Subjects, he cou'd neither leave <hi>Copenhagen</hi> nor diſmiſs his Army without expoſing himſelf to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; he wrote to the Vice-roy of <hi>Sweden,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to march with his Army, in order to bring the Rebels to reaſonable Terms, and at the ſame time he ſent Word to <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> That he would make his Mother and his Siſters to ſuffer the moſt cruel Torments; if he underſtood that he appear'd again at the Head of the Rebels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> deſpiſing his Threats, continu'd ſtill to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance with his <hi>Dalecarlians,</hi> puting all the <hi>Danes</hi> he met with to the Sword, and even the <hi>Swedes</hi> who adher'd to them or to the Archbiſhop; and his Forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd daily, during his March, ſo that in a ſhort Time he ſaw himſelf at the Head of an Army of above Fifteen thouſand Men, all animated with his Courage and Reſentment, and reſolv'd either to conquer or die.

               <p>No ſooner was he come to the Banks of the River but he ſaw <hi>Guſtavus</hi> appear on the other Side, at the Head of his Horſe, and ready to force his Paſſage. He was ſo daunted at the Sight of ſo reſolute an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that he retir'd with much Precipitation, and baſely left a Poſt, where he might have fought with Advantage, either becauſe he was diffident of his own Capacity, in giving the neceſſary Orders, and Commanding during the Heat and Tumult of the Action, or becauſe he durſt not truſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who were very numerous in his Army. He retir'd at firſt into the Caſtle of <hi>Weſteras,</hi> which was not far off; but not thinking himſelf ſafe while he was ſo near <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> and fearing a Siege if he ſhou'd continue, he left the beſt part of his Troops to defend that Place, and, returning to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> ſhut himſelf up in the Caſtle of that City, where he began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his Luxury, without ſuffering any Buſineſs to be brought before him, as tho' by his Retreat, and keeping out all bad News, he could keep out the Enemy, or put a Stop to their Progreſs.</p>

                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> took all the Advantage which the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy's Retreat aſſorded him; he laid a Bridge over the River, his Forces paſs'd it without any Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and continu'd their March towards <hi>Weſteras,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Weſtmania.</hi> It was equally danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for him to leave behind him a place of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, or to ſpend too much time in beſieging it: Moſt of his Troops were compos'd of Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that were very unfit for this way of Fighting; he had neither Powder nor Cannon; the Place was defended by a numerous Garriſon, little differing from an Army, and the Length and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<note place="margin">May 11.</note> either to render him ſuſpected to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Miniſters, or to gain and draw him to his Party.

His Agent repreſented to that Magiſtrate, how much 'twas the Intereſt of that Republick, and of all the other <hi>Hanſe</hi>-Towns, that <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould be always ſeparated from, and at enmity with <hi>Denmark;</hi> that the Regency of <hi>Lubeck</hi> could never meet with a more favourable opportunity to ſettle the Affairs of that Kingdom; that <hi>Guſtavus</hi> had already made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of ſeveral large Provinces, and that he had compleated all theſe Conqueſts at the Head of the <hi>Dalecarlians,</hi> but that theſe Peaſants ſerving for the moſt part without Pay, were alſo free from any Tie or Engagement, and that they were not ignorant that thoſe who begin a Revolt, and undertake a War with the greateſt eagerneſs, are uſually ſooneſt tir'd; that his Maſter ſtood in need of a Fleet to beſiege <hi>Stockholm,</hi> and the other Maritim Towns of the Kingdom, as
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62547:91"/>alſo of ſome regular Troops to carry on the War; and that this Lord hop'd with theſe Supplies, within a little while to expel the <hi>Danes</hi> out of the whole Kingdom of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conſul of <hi>Lubeck</hi> gave an account of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to the Regency; but theſe Republicans found that their Intereſt was chang'd with the fortune of <hi>Guſtavus.</hi> The rapid progreſs of his Conqueſts, his undaunted Courage and aſpiring Genius began to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb 'em, and <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> on the contrary ceas'd to be any longer formidable to 'em by reaſon of his violent Proceedings with reſpect to his own Subjects.</p>
               <p>But tho' <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Agent made little progreſs in his Negotiation, he had the good fortune to meet with an old <hi>German</hi> Colonel, nam'd <hi>Stephen de Saſſi,</hi> who was one of thoſe Soldiers of Fortune that make a Trade of War, and are always ready to venture their Lives for Gain, without taking any care to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Juſtice of the Cauſe which they engage to defend. <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Envoy treated with him in the name of his Maſter, and in conſideration of a certain Sum agreed upon, a conſiderable part of which was paid in hand, the Colonel oblig'd himſelf to Land in <hi>Sweden</hi> before the end of the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at the Head of 1200 Men. <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Agent inſtantly gave him an account of this Treaty, and receiv'd Orders to continue at <hi>Lubeck</hi> to ſolicit that Regency to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in his favour; but he thought fit to acquaint him at the ſame time, that he was ſenſible there would not have been ſo much difficulty in prevailing with theſe Republicans, if he had not made ſo quick a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and if the ſucceſs of his Enterprize were more uncertain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> had not hitherto met with any Diſaſter, every thing having ſucceeded beyond his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He was at the Head of a conſiderable Army, with which he had made himſelf Maſter of half the Kingdom, and the reſt of <hi>Sweden</hi> waited only for
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62547:92"/>his Preſence to declare in his Favour, when in the full career of his Conqueſts, he ſaw himſelf ſuddenly abandon'd by the greater part of his Forces;
<note place="margin">July 10.</note> for the Peaſants begg'd leave of him to be diſmiſs'd, that they might go and take care of the Harveſt in their Provinces. <hi>Gustavus,</hi> notwithſtanding the urgent neceſſity of his Affairs, could not refuſe thoſe People who ſerv'd him voluntarily, and to whom he was alſo oblig'd for all his Authority; and therefore he conſented to their departure, upon the promiſe they made him to return with a Reinforcement af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Harveſt, reſerving only for his Guard and for the Defence of the City of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Horſe and ſix hundred Foot, for the moſt part <hi>Dalecarlians,</hi> who were reſolv'd to follow his Fortune, and never to leave him.</p>
               <p>He reſided at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> which was as it were the Center of his Conqueſts, from whence he gave out neceſſary Orders thro' all the Provinces that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd for him, and where his Lieutenants carry'd on the War in his Name: He endeavour'd, at the ſame time to divide and diſtract his Enemies by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Negotiations, till he ſhou'd be in a condition to reduce 'em by Force.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop was more eſpecially formidable to him, by reaſon of the great Number of his Vaſſals and Followers; for he alone was capable of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting <hi>Chriſtiern</hi>'s Party by the Reputation of his Family, and his Authority over the Clergy. He ſent Letters thro' the Provinces, obliging his Relations and Friends to endeavour to retain the People in their Obedience to the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> ſo that <hi>Guſtavus</hi> met with, in the ſingle Perſon of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, a vigilant Enemy, that created him more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than all the <hi>Danes</hi> together. However, he made an attempt to draw him off from their Party, and engag'd two Canons of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> who imagin'd they had a great Intereſt with the Archbiſhop. <hi>Guſtavus</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:62547:92"/>publickly granted 'em a Paſs, under colour that they deſir'd Leave to Retire to their Metropolitan, and at the ſame time privately charg'd 'em with a Letter, which was ſubmiſſive, full of Reſpect, and proper to flatter the haughty and arrogant Temper of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. In this Letter he conjur'd him no longer to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Liberty of his Country; and offer'd, with all poſſible Demonſtrations of Sincerity to reſtore his City of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> and his whole Eſtate, without exacting any other Conditions than to engage in his Party, and to be their Head; aſſuring him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, That every one would be ready to obey his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with Delight, and that for his own part, he ſhould only reſerve to himſelf the Glory of putting his Advice and Counſels in Execution.</p>
               <p>The two Canons being arriv'd at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Letter to the Archbiſhop, and even took the boldneſs to commend his Moderation, on purpoſe to feel the Pulſe of that Prelate. But the Archbiſhop rejected the Letter and their Service, with a great deal of Scorn and Indignation; and fearing leſt the <hi>Danes</hi> ſhou'd ſuſpect that he hearken'd to their Propoſals, he caus'd the Letter to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately carry'd to the Vice-roy: He alſo ſent to him, at the ſame Time, the Perſons of the two Canons, who were the Bearers of it, and demanded that they ſhould be put to Death as Traytors and Spies.</p>
               <p>The Vice-roy, who knew not how to deſtroy his Enemies but when he found 'em unarm'd, would have made no great Difficulty to give him this Satisfaction if he had not been afraid of offending the Clergy, who almoſt alone continu'd to adhere to the party of the <hi>Danes:</hi> He alſo perceiv'd that the Archbiſhop requir'd their Death with ſo much earneſtneſs, only to take off a Suſpicion, which might ariſe, that he held Correſpondence with <hi>Guſtavus:</hi> Beſides that, theſe Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, terrifi'd with the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they had incurr'd, proteſted to him, They took
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62547:93"/>the Charge of <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Letter, only to obtain a Paſs, and the liberty of departing out of a City, which was no longer ingag'd in their Party. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they inveigh'd againſt the Rebellion of that Lord, with an Eloquence that was the effect of their Fear. They promis'd an unviolable Fidelity to King <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> whom they acknowledg'd as their lawful Sovereign; and the more effectually to juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and appeaſe the Anger of the Vice-roy and Archbiſhop, they told 'em, That the Peaſants had abandon'd <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> and gave 'em an account of the ſtate of the City, and the Forces of that Lord, which they likewiſe diminiſh'd, according to the uſual Language of Deſerters, on purpoſe to make their Court, and to obtain a more favourable Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop demanded Troops of the Vice-roy, with which he promis'd to ſurprize <hi>Guſtavus</hi> in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> and bring him back Priſoner, or at leaſt to force him to flee once more to the Mountains of <hi>Dale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carlia.</hi> In compliance with his Deſire, the Vice-roy gave him three thouſand Foot and five hundred Horſe, which was the greateſt part of the Gariſon of <hi>Stockholm:</hi> The Archbiſhop marcht, at the Head of theſe Forces, with ſo much Diligence and Secrecy, that he was very near ſeizing on the Perſon of <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtavus</hi> in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal;</hi> for he receiv'd Advice of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns only 2 Hours before his Arrival, by the means of two <hi>Swediſh</hi> Gentlemen, who ſeem'd ſtill of the Archbiſhop's Party,

The City was large and open on all Sides, and the Inhabitants were alſo well-affected to the Archbiſhop, who was their Lord, and therefore <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtavus</hi> did not think ſit, with ſo ſmall a number of Troops, that remain'd under his Command to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Defence of the Place, but inſtantly caus'd

               <p>He had ſcarce got out of the City, when the Archbiſhop enter'd it, at the Head of all his Forces, and as ſoon as he was inform'd of <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he purſu'd him with all his Horſe. The <hi>Danes</hi> overtook him at the Ford of <hi>Lateby,</hi> where his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, already terrifi'd with a precipitated Retreat, ran away at the ſight of the Enemy, and even his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, tho' retain'd by his Preſence, were diſmay'd while the whole multitude, preſs'd forward to gain the Foreſt. His Squire being mounted on an unruly Horſe, and hurry'd away in this Diſorder, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily fell upon his Maſter, and threw him backward into the Water, out of which he was immediately reſcued by his Guards. But <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was ſo far from being daunted with the Hazard he had run, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by the Number of his Enemies, that he rode boldly at the Head of his Guards; and that brave Lord, who was equally remarkable for the grateful heighth of his Stature and undaunted Courage, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd almoſt alone the whole Shock of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Army, while his Troops were gaining the Foreſt: As ſoon as he ſaw them in Safety, he retir'd in ſpite of the Multitude of thoſe that charg'd him, having loſt in the Encounter only ten or twelve Horſe, ſo that this was all the Advantage that the Archbiſhop gain'd from an Opportunity by which Fortune and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Troops ſeem'd to aſſure him an entire Victory.</p>
               <p>The Danger to which he had been expos'd by the means of this Prelate, ſerv'd only to revive his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and reſentment, ſo that he form'd a Deſign to ſurprize him by way of Retaliation; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he recall'd part of the Troops, which he had given to <hi>Arwide,</hi> and ſent them Orders to lie hid in the Woods on the Road from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Thus the greater part of the <hi>Danes</hi> were cut to pieces, and the reſt provided for their Safety by Flight. The Archbiſhop, who had boaſted that he

The <hi>German</hi> Soldiers firſt brought it thither, but their Religion conſiſted only in their Licentiouſneſs and the Contempt with which they treated the Monks and all ſorts of Religious Orders. Afterwards the two Brothers <hi>Laurentius</hi> and <hi>Olaus Petri,</hi> of the Province of <hi>Nericia</hi> propagated this Doctrin with very great Succeſs. They had both ſtudied under <hi>Luther</hi> in the Univerſity of <hi>Witemberg;</hi> they brought both his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin and Writings into <hi>Sweden,</hi> and publiſh'd them with all the Zeal that is uſually ſhewn in the divulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of new Opinions, eſpecially when 'tis believ'd to be neceſſary that old Errors ſhould be confuted, and the Truth eſtabliſh'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laurentius Petri,</hi> who was naturally timorous, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd his Sentiments with much reſervedneſs and Precaution; he contented himſelf only with diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Luther</hi>'s Books in private, and diſcourſing about them with his particular Friends; but <hi>Olaus,</hi> who was bold and cloquent, publickly preach'd <hi>Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> in the Church of <hi>Stregnez,</hi> whereof he was Canon and Protonotary: He inveigh'd in his Sermons againſt the ill uſe the Clergy and Monks made of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Riches, and was chearfully heard by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who were not ignorant that the Ambition of the Biſhops had caus'd all the Calamities of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterward he held Conferences, poſted up <hi>Theſes</hi> in <hi>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62547:95"/>that City, and finally left no means unattempted to ſpread abroad his Maſter's Doctrin, during the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and Commotions of the Civil War; a Time always favourable for the Change or eſtabliſhment of new Religions. Theſe Opinions were readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd by the Youth, and he gain'd the moſt part of the Profeſſors and Scholars of the Univerſity, who eſteem'd it their honor to become the Miniſters and Publiſhers of that Doctrin, and every one was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be inſtructed in it. Thus <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> paſs'd inſenſibly from the School into the Houſes of private Perſons, and the Families were divided, every one taking part according to his Inclination; while ſome maintain'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, becauſe it was that of their Fathers, and ſome adher'd to it purely upon the ſcore of its Antiquity; others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of the Abuſes which the Covetouſneſs of the Clergy had introduc'd into the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and attack'd thoſe Abuſes with ſo much the more Heat, as they found it their Intereſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit 'em. The very Women engag'd in theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, ſome out of Vanity and others thro' an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Fear of not being in the true way to Salvation; and every one ſet up for a Judge of Controverſies. The remaining part of the Biſhops of <hi>Sweden,</hi> after the Maſſacre of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> being more mindful of <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Conqueſts than of their Epiſcopal Functions in their reſpective Dioceſſes, took no notice of the Progreſs of <hi>Lutheraniſm. Guſtavus,</hi> for his part was deſirous to conceal his Knowledge of theſe Opinions, whether he look'd upon them as the Effect of ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes among idle Divines; or perhaps he was not diſpleas'd, that in a Kingdom, in which the Biſhops had ſo far oppos'd his Deſigns, there ſhould ariſe, even from amidſt the Clergy, a Party that made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of condemning the Temporal Power, and great Revenues of thoſe Prelates.</p>

The Vice-Roy and Archbiſhop having little aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Fidelity of the Burghers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afraid of falling into the Hands of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> reſolv'd to make their Eſcape whilſt the Sea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd open.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62547:101"/>But about two days Journey from the Town, he met with the unwelcome News of the Defeat of his two Officers that lay before it, and of the raiſing of the Siege. <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> had made a deſperate Eſſort to prevent the Loſs of <hi>Sweden;</hi> he had ſet out a potent Fleet, mann'd with a conſiderable number of Land Forces, and Admiral <hi>Norbi,</hi> who expreſs'd a great deal of Zeal and Forwardneſs on this Occaſion, was intruſted with the Conduct of the Expedition.</p>
               <p>That Lord could not forgive <hi>Guſtavus</hi> for getting the ſtart of him, and baulking the ſecret Deſigns he had form'd againſt <hi>Sweden;</hi> and <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that his extream Averſion and Spight againſt that Prince, which he did not endeavour to diſſemble, proceeded merely from his Loyalty and Zeal for the Intereſt of his Sovereign. He had us'd a great deal of Diligence, and ev'n ſpent a great deal of Mony in ſitting out the Fleet: His Friends accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him in the Expedition, the Troops that he commanded were abſolutely devoted to him, and he ſtill entertain'd ſome flattering Hopes that if he cou'd beat <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> 'twou'd not be impoſſible to obtain the Dignity of <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> and afterwards to mount the Throne, by improving the violent Hatred with which the <hi>Swedes</hi> were poſſeſs'd, againſt the Tyranny of his Maſter.</p>

                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> had no Fleet at Sea to diſpute the paſſage of the <hi>Danes;</hi> their Admiral enter'd without any oppoſition into the Port of <hi>Stockholm,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">April.</note> and as ſoon as his Troops were landed, made a Sally with all his Forces to ſurprize the Beſiegers. There was a lucky Combination of ſeveral Circumſtances that ſeem'd to favour the execution of his Deſigns; for beſides the Weakneſs of his Enemies at Sea, there was a fatal miſ-underſtanding betwixt the two Officers that commanded the Siege. The <hi>German</hi> Colonel, who was an old and Weather beaten Soldier, claim'd the ſupream Command, as an Honour due to his Skill
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62547:101"/>and Experience: But the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Officer was too proud and conſident of his own Courage, and too jealous of the Honor of his Nation, to ſubmit to a Man whom he did not think braver than himſelf. After this unhappy Difference they lodg'd their Troops in ſeparate Quarters, without the leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between one another: They acted on all Occaſions like declar'd Enemies, and were more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of each other, than of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Garriſon, whom they deſpis'd both for their Weakneſs and the ſmallneſs of their Numbers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Norbi</hi> taking the advantage of ſo favourable an Opportunity, made a Sally upon <hi>Fredage</hi>'s Quarters; and the <hi>Swedes</hi> were ſo ill prepar'd to receive him, that they abandon'd their Lines, and endeavour'd to ſave themſelves by a ſhameful Flight. The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Colonel was ſo far from aſſiſting 'em, that he remain'd an unconcern'd Spectator of the Action, and ev'n rejoyc'd at their Misfortune: But he was ſoon made ſenſible of his Imprudence, for his Camp was attack'd ſo vigorouſly by the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Admiral, that his Soldiers were not able to endure ſo ſurions a Shock, and fled after a ſlight Reſiſtance. Thus <hi>Norbi</hi> had the good Fortune to ſucceed in his firſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and that he might not loſe the Fruit of ſo important a Victory, he order'd the Soldiers of the Garriſon to fill up the Lines, and demoliſh all the Enemies Works, while the reſt of the Troops were in purſuit of the routed Beſiegers.</p>
               <p>Yet the Shame and Confuſion of this Deſent, was greater than the Loſs they ſuſtain'd; for the greateſt part of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Troops rally'd again under their reſpective Officers. The two Commanders endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd reciprocally to caſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62547:102"/>that unhappy Diviſion, to ſuffer it to make a further Progreſs. He march'd with all poſſible haſte to the Army, and by his Preſence depriv'd 'em both of that Power and Superiority, which was the main Cauſe of their Hatred and Jealouſy. Immediately after he gave Orders to his Troops to repair to their former Poſts, and renew'd the Siege, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great ſharpneſs of the Winter, that the News of his Arrival might prevent, or at leaſt leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Noiſe of the Defeat of his Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Norbi</hi> was not much alarm'd at this ſecond At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which was rather a <hi>Blockade</hi> than a <hi>Siege.</hi> He loſe a great Garriſon in the Town, and being Maſter of the Sea ſet ſail for <hi>Finland,</hi> where he put to Flight <hi>Arwide</hi>'s Brother, whom <hi>Guſtavus</hi> had ſent to reduce that Province.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> perceiving that he cou'd not hope to ſucceed in his Deſigns, nor to make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> without a <hi>Fleet</hi> to block up the Port, diſpatch'd his Secretary <hi>Siguard de Holten</hi> to haſten the Succors which that <hi>Republic</hi> had promis'd him, and to obtain a ſufficient Number both of <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Ships</hi> to carry on the War. This <hi>Envoy</hi> was more favourably receiv'd than his Predeceſſor; for the Magiſtrates of that City had heard of the Action at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> and believ'd the Accounts that were induſtriouſly ſpread abroad by the <hi>Danes,</hi> who gave out that the <hi>Adminiſtrator's</hi> Army was totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. And therefore ſince 'twas their Intereſt to prevent the utter Ruin of that Prince, as well as to curb the Progreſs of his Victories, they were ſoon perſwaded to grant the Succors which he demanded, thinking by that means to perpetrute the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Northern Crowns. They oblig'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelve, to ſend forthwich Eighteen Men of War, with Four thouſand Soldiers, furniſh'd with one Year's Pay: But at the ſame time they reſolv'd to make the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> pay dear for the <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> they gave him.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62547:102"/>
               <p>They propos'd, That he ſhou'd enter into an Obligation in the Name and Behalf of the States of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to pay to their City for the Charge of the Fleet, the Sum of <hi>Sixty thouſand Marks</hi> of Silver; That till the Kingdom ſhou'd be in a Condition to advance ſo conſiderable a Sum, the Merchants of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> Trading to <hi>Sweden,</hi> ſhou'd be exempted from all Cuſtoms and Duties, for the Goods which they ſhou'd either Export or Import; That no other Nation ſhou'd be permitted to Trade in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; That the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> ſhou'd not conclude a Peace or Truce with <hi>Denmark,</hi> without the Conſent of the <hi>Regency;</hi> and, That in caſe they ſhou'd be attack'd by <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> he ſhou'd be oblig'd to invade <hi>Denmark</hi> with <hi>Twenty thouſand Men,</hi> to make a Diverſion.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of theſe Conditions ſeem'd very hard to <hi>Guſtavus:</hi> For he perceiv'd that the execution of this Treaty wou'd ruin the Trade of the Kingdom, and quite deſtroy the Revenue of the Crown, which at that time conſiſted almoſt wholly in the Cuſtoms that were laid upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation and Exportation of Goods. But on the other Hand, there was an abſolute Neceſſity for a Fleet to carry on the Siege of <hi>Stockholm, Calmar,</hi> and other Maritime Places. He had no Mony either to build or buy Ships, and was ſenſible that as long as <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> ſhou'd remain Maſter of the Sea, and conſequently of theſe Ports, he might eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the War, by pouring in freſh Forces into the Kingdom. Thus the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> was conſtrain'd to conclude a Treaty, which wou'd have been ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diſhonourable, if it had not been neceſſary: <hi>Siguard de Holten</hi> ſign'd it by his Order, and the Fleet ſet Sail ſome time after. <hi>Frederick Brum</hi> was <hi>Admiral</hi> of the <hi>Navy,</hi> and the <hi>Land Forces</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>John Stammel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fleet arriv'd ſafely in the Port of <hi>Sudercopinc</hi> on <hi>Whitſon</hi>-Eve, and the Troops that were to ſerve a Shoar were landed. As ſoon as the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62547:103"/>receiv'd the News of their Arrival, he ſent <hi>Bernard de Milen,</hi> who was their Country-man, to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Oath of Fidelty to 'em: But they reſus'd obſtinately to obey or acknowledge that Officer, tho' he was a Native of <hi>Germany.</hi> They begg'd earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they might ſee <hi>Guſtavus;</hi> and the greateſt part of 'em proteſted that they wou'd never have left their Country, if they had not expected to ſerve under a Prince whoſe Valor was celebrated thro' all <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſatisfy theſe Foreign Auxiliaries, the <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator</hi> was oblig'd to take a Journey to <hi>Sudercepinc.</hi> He charm'd 'em with the gracefulneſs of his Mien, and gain'd their Hearts with the winning Eloquence of his Diſcourſe. They took the uſual Oath of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity for the time their Superiors had engag'd 'em in his Service, with all imaginable Expreſſions of Joy and Chearfulneſs; and reſolv'd to follow his Fortune with as ardent a Zeal, as if they had been born his Subjects.</p>
               <p>He made uſe of theſe Troops to reinforce the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that lay before <hi>Stockholm,</hi> ordering 'em to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp on the ſide next the Sea, over againſt the Port, which was the weakeſt part of the Camp. At the ſame time he form'd a Squadron of as many Ships as he cou'd find, and gave the Command of it to <hi>Eric Fleming,</hi> a <hi>Finlandiſh</hi> Lord, with Orders to Cruiſe before the Harbor, that all Hope of Relief might be cut off from the Beſieg'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fleming</hi> lying in the height of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd a Squadron of <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ships making their way directly towards the Harbor. This was a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Convoy, commanded by the Governor of <hi>Aboo,</hi> whom <hi>Norbi</hi> had ſent to re-victual <hi>Stockholm;</hi> for it ſeems he had not yet receiv'd Advice that the <hi>Regency</hi> of <hi>Lubeck</hi> had declar'd for the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and that their Fleet kept the Sea. Immediately <hi>Fleming</hi> gave Orders to all his Ships to ſtand in behind the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62547:103"/>Cape of <hi>Stockholm;</hi> and in the mean time the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, with the Ships under his Command, advanc'd with a favourable Gale, having order'd two light Frigats to ſail before the Fleet, at an equal diſtance, to make Diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the firſt of theſe Frigats had doubl'd the Cape, ſhe was ſurrounded and taken by <hi>Fleming,</hi> who took out all the Ship's Company, and mann'd her with <hi>Swediſh</hi> Seamen and Soldiers. Then, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſing time, he went on Board his Prize, and put out to Sea to meet the other Frigat, which was making the beſt of her way, without the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of what had happen'd. As ſoon as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore of the Convoy, who was on Board that Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, perceiv'd the firſt Frigat making towards him, he came in his Boat to learn the Cauſe of her return; but inſtead of receiving the Advice he expected, he found himſelf in the Hands of his Enemies. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <hi>Fleming</hi> gave the Signal for the whole Fleet to come up; and made himſelf Maſter of the Convoy and all the Ships in his Company, before the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, who were at a loſs for want of their Admiral, cou'd agree upon the Order of Battle. There was only one <hi>Finlandiſh</hi> Ship that made Reſiſtance; the Captain defended himſelf with extraordinary Valor from Noon till Night; and at laſt choſe rather to burn his Ship, than to fall under the power of his Enemies. The Commodore of the Convoy was hang'd by <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Order, by way of Repriſal, or Retaliation, for the Cruelties he had committed in his Government.</p>
               <p>This was a very mortifying piece of News to Admiral <hi>Norbi,</hi> who, reckoning himſelf Maſter of theſe Seas, cou'd not endure to be affronted in his own Element, by ſuch bungling Seamen as the <hi>Swedes</hi> were generally reputed to be. He order'd his Fleet to be ſitted out with all poſſible haſte; and as ſoon as it was ready to put to Sea, he ſet ſail with a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62547:104"/>Convoy of Proviſions and Soldiers for <hi>Stockholm,</hi> which was ſtill cloſely block'd up by <hi>Guſtavus.</hi> As ſoon as he drew near the <hi>Lubeck</hi>-Fleet and <hi>Fleming</hi>'s Squadron, which were Riding at Anchor in the Road of that City, the Guns on both ſides began to play very furiouſly, and the two Fleets continu'd a whole Day firing at one another without Intermiſſion. <hi>Norbi</hi> intended to renew the Fight next Morning; but perceiving ſome appearances of an approaching Storm, he was forc'd to ſtand in to a little Iſland, where there was ſafe Anchorage, tho' it was very near the Shoar.</p>
               <p>Having caſt Anchor in that place, he was ſurpriz'd in the Night with ſo violent a Froſt, that all his Ships were engag'd in the Ice. <hi>Guſtavus</hi> hearing of this Accident, reſolv'd not to neglect ſo fair an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of obtaining a compleat and eaſy Victory, by ſetting Fire to his Enemies Navy. In purſuance of that Deſign, he march'd immediately with the Forces of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> who were encamp'd on that ſide, and whom he thought fitter for ſuch an Attempt than the <hi>Dalecarlians</hi> and other <hi>Peaſants,</hi> of which his Army was compos'd. He paſs'd over into the Iſland upon the Ice, and gave Orders to the Soldiers to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance as near the Enemy as they cou'd, during the obſcurity of the Night. They quickly found that <hi>Norbi</hi> was not aſleep; for upon their Approach, they were ſaluted with repeated Diſcharges of great and ſmall Shot. However, they receiv'd the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Fire without ſhrinking, and march'd on boldly to the ſides of the Ships: Some ſhot Arrows, others darted burning Torches, and ſome, tranſported with the eagerneſs of their Courage, endeavour'd to climb up the ſides of the Ships; but they were quickly repuls'd and thrown down upon the Ice by the <hi>Danes,</hi> who fought with advantage upon the Decks of their Ships. The Action was extreamly hot on both ſides: The <hi>Danes</hi> were attack'd with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62547:104"/>extraordinary Vigor and Obſtinacy, and defended themſelves with no leſs Courage and Bravery; but notwithſtanding all their Care and Reſiſtance, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ships were ſet on Fire, and both the <hi>Conquer'd</hi> and <hi>Conquerors</hi> were forc'd, with equal haſte and precipitation, to avoid the fury of the mercileſs Flames. The gloomy Horror of the Night, the Shrieks of half-burnt Wretches, the falling of Maſts and cracking of the Ships, with the confus'd Medly of ſo many diſmal Objects, ſtruck the moſt undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Minds with a ſecret and reſiſtleſs Terror. The <hi>Danes</hi> were at once aſſaulted by the raging Fire and their victorious Enemies: They had already loſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ships, and cou'd not have ſav'd one of the reſt, if thoſe who commanded under <hi>Guſtavus</hi> wou'd have compleated the Victory.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lubeck</hi> General order'd a Retreat to be ſounded in the heat of the Action,
<note place="margin">John Stammel.</note> and in ſpight of <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Threats and Intreaties, drew off his Troops, under pretext that they were too much expos'd to the Enemies Fire. 'Tis not certainly known whether he was ſecretly gain'd by <hi>Norbi,</hi> as the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> ſuſpected; or whether he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd private Orders from his Superiors to prolong the War, by ballancing the Advantages on both ſides. The Seaſon was not yet ſo far advanc'd, but that the Heat of the Sun in the Morning was ſtrong enough to thaw the Ice,
<note place="margin">Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> which was quickly diſpers'd by a brisk Southerly Gale, which happen'd to ariſe at the ſame time. <hi>Norbi</hi> ſet ſail immediately, and retir'd to the Port of <hi>Calmar,</hi> with the reſt of his Fleet which was extreamly ſhatter'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was enrag'd at the <hi>Lubeck</hi> General's Treachery, who, by an ill-tim'd Retreat, had robb'd him of a certain Victory, and retarded the Conqueſt of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> upon which the ſucceſs of all his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſigns depended. He was convinc'd, by this Action, that he cou'd not ſafely rely upon ſuch Allies, who
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62547:105"/>had only aſſiſted him out of a politic Deſign to put a ſtop to the growing power of <hi>Denmark;</hi> and concluded that they wou'd not only withdraw their Aſſiſtance, but turn their Arms againſt him, if he ſhou'd, by extending his Conqueſts, make himſelf the Object of their Fear. However, the neceſſity of having a Fleet to block up the Port of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> made him diſſemble his Anger; and having ſent thoſe Foreign Troops into good Winter Quarters, he continu'd the Blockade with an Army of his own Subjects, who were accuſtom'd to endure Cold, and to encamp in the Snow. In the mean time he took care to keep ſo ſtrict a Guard upon all the Avenues of the Town, that 'twas impoſſible for the Enemy to ſupply it either with Men or Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Norbi</hi> hearing of the Extremity to which the Place was reduc'd, reſolv'd to hazard another Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as ſoon as the Sea ſhou'd be open. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd a great deal of care and charge upon the Careening and Fitting out of his Fleet, and Mann'd it with a conſiderable Number of Soldiers, whom he drew out of the Garriſons of the Iſle of <hi>Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and of the City of <hi>Calmar,</hi> of which he was Governour. He was ſtill entertaining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the pleaſing hope of forcing <hi>Guſtavus</hi> once more to raiſe the Siege of the Capital City of <hi>Sweden,</hi> when he receiv'd advice that all <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> was in Arms againſt <hi>Chriſtiern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That violent Prince contemning the Laws and Privileges of his Country, imagin'd that he might, without controul, diſpoſe of the Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of his Subjects as he pleas'd, and make his own fantaſtical humour the Standard and Meaſure of his Government. The Biſhops and Nobility were the principal Objects of his Fury; for the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own Guilt made him conclude that they cou'd not continue Loyal to their Tyrannical Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62547:105"/>He had put to Death ſeveral Lords and two Biſhops without any form of Juſtice; and both the Clergy and Nobility were equally incens'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Thoſe Barbarities and the Maſſacre of <hi>Stockholm</hi> procur'd him the hatred of all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but their <hi>Hatred</hi> was accompanied with ſo much <hi>Fear,</hi> that notwithſtanding all his Cruelties, he might have ſtill continu'd on the Throne if he had not over-loaded the <hi>Danes</hi> with inſupportable Taxes and Impoſitions to carry on the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Sweden,</hi> which was ſtill his predominant Paſſion.</p>
               <p>At laſt the People grew weary of Slavery and Oppreſſion, and cou'd not longer bear the unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable Yoak of ſo Tyrannical a Government: They loſt their <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> at the ſame time that they loſt their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and chearfully imbrac'd the Quarrel of the Clergy and Nobility: All things being ripe for an univerſal Inſurrection, and the Conſpiracy being carried on by the United Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Intereſts of all the Eſtates and Orders of the Kingdom; they enter'd into a ſecret Treaty with <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>Oldenburgh,</hi> Duke of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Norbi</hi> receiv'd the news of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Flight and <hi>ABDICATION,</hi> he took his leave of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and gave over his deſign of reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Stockholm.</hi> He left a weak Garriſon in <hi>Calmar,</hi> and retir'd with his whole Fleet to the Iſle of <hi>Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> under pretext of ſecuring it for <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> tho' his true Deſign was to keep it for himſelf, and under the Name of that Prince to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the abſolute Maſter and Sovereign of the Iſland, while the Kingdoms of the North were diſtracted with ſuch terrible confuſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> reſolv'd to make the beſt advantage of his Enemies retreat. He had ſome ſecret intelligence in <hi>Calmar,</hi> who prevail'd with the <hi>Burghers</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Troops in the Night; and the whole Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon was put to the Sword. At the ſame time <hi>Arwide</hi> ſeiz'd on the Iſle of <hi>Docland,</hi> and <hi>Bernard de Milen</hi> Conquer'd all <hi>Bleking.</hi> And theſe ſucceſſes were quickly follow'd with the Reduction of the whole Kingdom, except <hi>Stockholm,</hi> and ſome places in <hi>Finland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Garriſon of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> weaken'd by the length of the Siege, ſtraiten'd both by Land and Sea, and kept in Awe by the <hi>Burghers</hi> of the City, who did not longer conceal their Affection to the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator,</hi> began to think of Capitulating. They knew not for whoſe ſake they ſuffer'd all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities of ſo cloſe a Siege; and were reduc'd to ſuch Extremities, by want of Pay and of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Proviſions, that they offer'd to ſurrender, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting only on the Payment of the Arrears due to 'em ſince they enter'd into the Place.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Gustavus</hi> did not think fit to obſerve his uſual Maxim on this occaſion; for tho' 'twas ſo much his intereſt to be Maſter of that City, he rejected the advantageous Propoſals th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> were made to him
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62547:107"/>by the Garriſon. He knew that their Numbers were extreamly leſſen'd, and that they wanted both Victuals and Powder. But this ſeeming Severity was only a pretext to prolong the Siege for ſome days, which in the preſent juncture was a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary piece of policy for the Advancement of his Fortune, and the carrying on of his ſecret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. He ſaw that <hi>Sweden</hi> was abſolutely deliver'd from the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Yoke; that <hi>Christiern</hi> was hated and ſlighted by all the World, and that he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd about like a miſerable Exile, begging the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his former Allies to reſtore him to the Crown of <hi>Denmark. Guſtavus</hi> had never a nearer Proſpect of mounting the Throne; but at the ſame time he ſtood in need of his moſt reſin'd Politicks to manage ſo nice a Game: He conſider'd that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> inſtead of ſixing him on the Throne, might ſet him at a further diſtance from it: He knew that <hi>Ingratitude</hi> is the uſual Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Security,</hi> and was afraid that the <hi>Swedes</hi> being freed from the apprehenſion of a common Enemy, wou'd not unanimouſly concur to his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Eſtabliſhment of his Authority. And therefore he concluded that the beſt reſolution he cou'd take in ſo Critical a Juncture was to lengthen the Siege of their Capital City, that the uncertainty of ſo important an event might keep 'em in awe, and in a dependence upon his Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>In purſuance of this Deſign he call'd a Meeting or <hi>Convention of the Estates</hi> at <hi>Stregnez,</hi>

               <p>This Diſcourſe was receiv'd with an univerſal Applauſe.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62547:108"/>by every Mouth, he was the Object of every Eye; and all in general endeavour'd to expreſs their Joy at his Election, and to congratulate their own Happineſs, in having an opportunity to contribute to his Advancement.</p>
               <p>The Privce was charm'd with ſo many extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary demonſtrations of his Peoples Affection: He own'd that it exceeded all his Services, and that their Kindneſs was more agreeable to him than the Noble Eſſect of their Gratitude. He had ſo much <hi>real</hi> or <hi>ſeeming</hi> Modeſty as to decline the offer they made him: But the firſt Words he utter'd to that Effect, dampt the Joy of the whole Aſſembly. There was nothing to be ſeen or heard among 'em but Tears and Supplications; and ſo deep a Sorrow ſate upon every Face, that one wou'd have thought the <hi>Danes</hi> had ſtill been at the Gates of the City. At laſt he was prevail'd with to ſubmit to the pleaſing violence, and conſented to an Advancement, which was both a <hi>Reward</hi> and an <hi>Effect</hi> of his Valour and Prudence. He was ſolemnly acknowledg'd as King and Sovereign of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the two <hi>Gothlands;</hi> and receiv'd an Oath of Fidelity from the Senate and the Deputies of the Provinces.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eſtates</hi> wou'd have immediately proceeded to his <hi>Coronation,</hi> but he cunningly avoided that Ceremony, under pretext that he was oblig'd to return inſtantly to the Siege of <hi>Stockholm.</hi> The true Reaſon why he refus'd to be Crown'd ſo ſoon was, that he was not yet ſufficiently Eſtabliſh'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne, to refuſe the Oaths which the Clergy exacted upon ſuch Occaſions for the preſervation of their Rights and Privileges.</p>
               <p>He invited the Senate and the greateſt part of the Deputies to accompany him to the Army, that they might be preſent at the Surrendring of their Capital City. He knew the place cou'd not hold out longer; for the Garriſon was ſo pinch'd with

               <p>

He honour'd him with magnificent Preſents at his departure; and left no means uneſſay'd to gain him, or at leaſt to make him give an advantageous Character of his Power and Grandeur.

               </p>
               <p>Theſe Ladies were ſtill kept Priſoners in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark;</hi> and <hi>Guſtavus</hi> knew that he cou'd neither oblige the <hi>Swedes,</hi> nor raiſe his own Glory more effectually, than by procuring their Liberty.

               <p>The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Envoy, at his arrival at the Court of <hi>Denmark,</hi> deliver'd his Meſſage publickly, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Liberty of the Princeſs and the other <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ladies: But afterwards, in a private Audience, he complain'd, in his Maſter's Name, of the Injury that Monarch had receiv'd from the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> by ſending an Ambaſſador to <hi>Sweden,</hi> without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him with his Intention, or directing the Embaſſy to him. He repreſented to him, That the Kings, his Predeceſſors, notwithſtanding their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> were more careful to obſerve the common Rules of Decency, even dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the late War betwixt the two Kingdoms; and that they were ſo far from ſcrupling to acknowledge the Dignity and Authority of the <hi>Adminiſtrators,</hi> that they directed the Letters and Embaſſies to them, which they ſent to the whole Nation. He added, with a great deal of Courage and Reſolution, that 'twou'd be more proper, for a Prince that was not well fix'd upon his Throne, to ſecure his Intereſt at home, than to think of Invading his Neighbors; and that tho' the King, his Maſter, entertain'd not any ambitious Thoughts of aggrandizing himſelf or extending the Limits of his Dominions, his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Garriſons were in ſo good a Condition, that 'twas beyond the Power of all his Enemies to make themſelves Maſters of one Inch of <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ground.

Moſt of 'em had Youth enough to recommend 'em to ſecond Husbands; but almoſt all the Lords of their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were either kill'd in the Maſſacre of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> or were already marry'd. No Woman of Quality, whether Maid or Widow, was ſuffer'd, in <hi>Sweden,</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62547:112"/>to contract an Alliance with a Family leſs noble than her own. But the King remov'd that Obſtacle and permitted theſe Ladies to chuſe their Husbands as they pleas'd, tho' under that ſeeming Complaiſance he conceal'd a politic Deſign; for he manag'd their Inclinations ſo dexterouſly that they were eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to chuſe the principal Officers of his Army. He exhorted theſe Illuſtrious Widows to prefer Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit before Riches, and to beſtow their Fortunes and Affections on Men that had loſt part of their Blood in the Service of their Country, rather than on thoſe who deriv'd their Blood from a long ſeries of noble Anceſtors, but had never ſpent a drop of it for the defence and preſervation of the State. By theſe Alliances he ſecur'd the greateſt Families of the Kingdom, and at the ſame time found out a cheap way to reward his Creatures, and to enable 'em to ſerve him more effectually.</p>
               <p>Whatever Joy he expreſt at the Arrival of the <hi>Adminiſtrator's</hi> Widow, the inward ſatisfaction of his Mind was not anſwerable to thoſe external De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations. She had two Children, who were meer Infants at the death of her Husband, Prince <hi>Steno,</hi> for whoſe Memory and Family the <hi>Swedes</hi> had an extraordinary Veneration. <hi>Guſtavus</hi> took the two young Princes, under pretext of educating 'em in the Palace, and reſolv'd to provide a Husband for the Princeſs their Mother, who cou'd not draw any advantage from that Alliance to the prejudice of his Authority and Government. He propos'd and made her accept of <hi>Tureiohanſon,</hi> the firſt Senator and <hi>Great Mareſchal</hi> of the Kingdom. The King had conſider'd the Character of that Lord, and found him to be ſuch a Perſon as he deſign'd for a Husband to the Princeſs. He was a Man of great Quality, and had a conſiderable Eſtate both in <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark:</hi> He was extreamly proud of theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, but had neither Valor nor Courage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62547:113"/>him to the Eſteem and Affection of the Soldiers. His <hi>Birth</hi> was his only <hi>Merit,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he cou'd not be ſuppos'd to have any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Intereſt in a Kingdom where a <hi>brave War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> was infinitely more eſteem'd than one that cou'd only boaſt of his Deſcent from an <hi>Illuſtrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> made it his next care to ſind out the beſt Expedients to weaken the Power of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> whom he ſuſpected and hated for their great Riches, and for the Affection they ſtill retain'd to the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Government, which had always maintain'd their Authority. Arch-biſhop <hi>Trolle</hi> was ſtill a zealous Promoter of that Intereſt: 'Twas by his Advice that <hi>Frederic</hi> caus'd himſelf to be crown'd King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and to preſerve his Credit with that Prince, he entertain'd a ſecret Correſpondence with the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Clergy. The King was reſolv'd to humble a Body of Men, who by their Power and Cabals had always diſturb'd the Government and oppos'd the Authority of the Prince, and were never ſatisfied but when they were intruſted with the largeſt ſhare of the management of public Affairs. But he was oblig'd to defer the execution of that Deſign for ſome time, and was too prudent to begin his Reign with diſputing the Privileges of an Order, whom the moſt abſolute Prince ſhou'd never touch but with a tender and wary Hand.</p>
               <p>He contented himſelf at firſt with managing the Elections for the filling up of vacant Benefices. He procur'd two Perſons to be nam'd to the Biſhopricks of <hi>Stregnez</hi> and <hi>Weſteras,</hi>

By virtue of a Recommendation from the Court, which even then was not much different from an abſolute Order, the Choice fell upon one <hi>John Magnus,</hi> a Native of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who was learned in Scholaſtick Divinity, very pious, and of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Life. He was naturally of a fearful Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and unfit for the management of Affairs: He was a Lover of Solitude, and had no Intereſt in the Kingdom; and conſequently was neither capable of forming nor proſecuting any Deſigns againſt the Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> concluded that by theſe Nominations he had ſecur'd the Quiet of the State, which was uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſturb'd by the Ambition of the Biſhops. But as he was entertaining himſelf with the delightful Proſpect of an un-interrupted Proſperity, as the glorious Reward and Fruit of his Labours, and was preparing to make his Subjects ſenſible of their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs under the kind Influences of his Government, he was engag'd, by the Regency of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> in an Affair that put him to a great deal of Charge and Trouble.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Flight</hi> and <hi>ABDICATION</hi> of <hi>Chriſtiern,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1525"/> Severin de Norbi</hi> retir'd to the Iſle of <hi>Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> exclaiming againſt the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Rebellion, and proteſting that he wou'd revenge his Maſter's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries upon <hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> whom he brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the odious Name of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers.</hi> His Ships cruis'd perpetually upon the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, and took ſeveral conſiderable Prizes. The ſucceſs of his firſt Attempts, and the Richneſs of his Prizes made him extreamly arrogant; and he was ſo powerfully
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62547:114"/>charm'd with the tempting Proſpect of raiſing his Fortune by ſo quick and eaſy a way that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to Attack all the Ships that had the misſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to fall into his Hands, and made the Port of <hi>Wisbi,</hi> the Capital City of the Iſland, a Rendezvous or Retiring-Place for ſeveral other Pirates who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea. Thus of <hi>Admiral of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> he became a <hi>Captain of Pirates,</hi> and taking down the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Colours from his Ships, aſſum'd the Quality of <hi>Prince of Gothland.</hi> He ſtil'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the <hi>Friend of God,</hi> and <hi>Enemy of all the World;</hi> and boaſted with a great deal of Inſolence that he acknowledg'd no other Superiors but <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Merchants of <hi>Lubeck</hi> were poſſeſs'd of the whole Commerce and Trade of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to all other Nations, by Virtue of the Treaty which the Regency concluded with <hi>Gustavus</hi>'s Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary: And the Magiſtrates of that City had granted a Right of Partner-Ship to the <hi>Hanſe-Towns</hi> of <hi>Dantzick, Hamburgh, Roſtock, Wiſmar,</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh.</hi> But their Ships were ſo narrowly watch'd by <hi>Norbi,</hi> and the reſt of the Pirates, that few or none of them eſcap'd. The Regency of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> which for the moſt part was compos'd of the Principal Merchants of the City, being deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in theſe Loſſes, wou'd have aſſaulted <hi>Norbi</hi> and endeavour'd to unkennel the reſt of the <hi>Corſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> if they had not been deterr'd by the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of the War, and the uncertainty of the Event. In ſo preſſing a Difficulty they reſolv'd to have recourſe to the Celebrated Valour of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> and to ſend one of their principal Magiſtrates to engage him in the attempt, under pretext that the Iſle of <hi>Gothland</hi> was an Ancient <hi>Fief</hi> or Dependency of the Crown of <hi>Sweden.</hi> They intruſted the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation of ſo important an Affair to one <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> an Old Conſul of the City, who under the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62547:114"/>ſeeming Candour and Simplicity of an honeſt <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,</hi> conceal'd all the Craftineſs and Subtilty of the moſt diſſembling <hi>Stateſman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After his Arrival at <hi>Stockholm</hi> he complimented <hi>Guſtavus</hi> in the name of his Maſters, and Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated the Glory and Proſperity of his Reign. Then complaining of <hi>Norbi</hi>'s Piracies he told the King that the <hi>Regency</hi> wou'd have ſent an Army to <hi>Gothland,</hi> to extirpate that Neſt of Pirates, if they had not been certainly inform'd that the Iſland be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Crown of <hi>Sweden;</hi> that all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the North were ſurpriz'd that ſo potent and Victorious a Prince would ſuffer ſuch an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crew to chuſe a Retreat in his Dominions, that <hi>Sweden</hi> was in a manner inveſted by the Ships of thoſe inſolent Pirates; that his Majeſty's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and the intereſt of his Subjects oblig'd him to Scour the Seas of theſe Rovers, who ruin'd the Trade of his Kingdom; and that it would be of great Importance for the ſecurity of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make himſelf Maſter of an Iſland which cover'd the greateſt part of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Coaſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was not ignorant of the pretenſions he had to that Iſland, and of all the Advantages of its Situation with reſpect to <hi>Sweden;</hi> but he was loath to engage in a Foreign War, and to carry his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my out of the Kingdom in the beginning of his Reign, leſt ſome diſturbance ſhould happen, or <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> ſhould make a Deſcent, in his abſence. Nor was he Maſter of a ſufficient Fund to defray the Charge of ſo conſiderable an Expedition, much leſs to carry on the War, if <hi>Norbi</hi> ſhou'd make a longer Defence than he expected, or if the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſhould take his part, and concern himſelf in the Quarrel. And beſides, he was ſenſible that the only Reaſon which made thoſe Trading Cities ſo deſirous to engage him in a War with the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62547:115"/>Charge to ſecure 'em in the Poſſeſſion of thoſe vaſt Advantages they enjoy'd by ingroſſing the whole Commerce of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having duly weigh'd the Importance of theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he told the <hi>Lubeck</hi> Ambaſſador that he was not diſpos'd to undertake the Imployment of a <hi>Knight Errant,</hi> and to rove about the World in Queſt of Adventures; that his Preſence was neceſſary in his own Kingdom, and that 'twas reaſonable his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhou'd enjoy the ſweetneſs of a Peace which he had procur'd for 'em by the ſucceſs of his Arms. He added, that he was not ignorant of his undoubted Right to the Iſle of <hi>Gothland,</hi> but that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had alſo ſome pretenſions to the ſame Iſland, and conſequently that the Attempt in which the <hi>Regency</hi> of <hi>Lubeck</hi> wou'd engage him wou'd cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make that Prince his Enemy; and concluded with aſſuring the Ambaſſador that he wou'd endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to expel <hi>Norbi</hi> and the reſt of the Pyrates out of the Iſland, as ſoon as the Difference betwixt him and <hi>Frederick</hi> cou'd be brought to an amicable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lubeck</hi> Envoy perceiv'd by this Anſwer that the King was diſſatisfied that the Merchants of that City ſhou'd enjoy the whole advantage of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Commerce, without paying any Cuſtoms or Duties; and that he was reſolv'd to repay 'em in their own Coin by taking advantage of their preſent Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. And therefore to gain him to a Compliance with the Deſires of that Republic, he made the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Propoſals: That the <hi>Hanſe-Towns</hi> ſhou'd fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with a Fleet to tranſport his Forces into the iſland; that by the conſent of the <hi>Regency</hi> of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> the payment of the Sum due to that Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic from <hi>Sweden,</hi> ſhou'd be delay'd for five Years; and that in caſe his Majeſty cou'd not make himſelf Maſter of the Iſland, the <hi>Regency</hi> ſhou'd bear a ſhare in the Charge of the Expedition. He offer'd alſo
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62547:115"/>that the <hi>Hanſe-Towns,</hi> aſſociated with <hi>Lubeck,</hi> ſhou'd keep the Sea with a potent Fleet, to intercept any Succors or Relief that might be ſent from <hi>Denmark;</hi> and added, that in caſe King <hi>Frederic</hi> ſhou'd obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately perſiſt in claiming the Sovereignty of <hi>Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>Regency</hi> wou'd undertake to negotiate a Match betwixt his Majeſty and <hi>Dorothy</hi> the Princeſs of <hi>Denmark;</hi> and that in conſideration of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, her Father ſhou'd reſign all his Pretenſions to that Iſland.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador induſtriouſly divulg'd, both at Court and among the People, the advantageous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals he had made to the King, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> might think themſelves concern'd in the ſucceſs of his Negotiation. And beſides, he endeavour'd to perſwade ſome of the Senators, by ſubtil and crafty Inſinuations, that if the King ſhou'd reject the Offers he had made him, the <hi>Hanſe-Towns</hi> wou'd be oblig'd to have recourſe to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and to join their Forces with that Prince's Army to drive the Pirates out of the Iſland. At the ſame time he gain'd ſeveral Merchants who dealt and correſponded with thoſe of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and conſequently were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, as well as they, in the Prizes that were taken by <hi>Norbi.</hi> Thus he form'd a Party in the Senate, and among the Inhabitants of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> who had not yet loſt their Right to diſcover their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning State-Affairs. The common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſo accuſtom'd to hear of <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that they fanſied him to be invincible; and being cunningly wheedl'd by the Ambaſſador's Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, they ran to the Gates of the Palace, crying out all the way, that 'twas a ſhame for <hi>Sweden</hi> to ſuffer the Inſolency of thoſe Pyrates, who ruin'd the Trade of the Kingdom; that the Sea was ſo peſter'd with 'em that a Boat durſt ſcarce adventure to ſail out of the Port, and that they were not afraid to come within the reach of the Guns of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62547:116"/>Caſtle. And even ſome of the principal Lords of the Kingdom, perceiving that the King was ſtill irreſolute, cou'd not forbear telling him, that the <hi>Adminiſtrator Suanto</hi> wou'd never have ſuffer'd theſe Pirates to inſult the Coaſts of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> wou'd not bear a Reproach that ſeem'd to accuſe him of Weakneſs and Cowardiſe: He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, in an angry Tone, that neither his <hi>Friends</hi> nor his <hi>Enemies</hi> had over ſuſpected him of want of Courage; that he wou'd no longer reſiſt their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, but that he might venture to foretel that the ſucceſs of that Expedition wou'd not anſwer their Deſires and Expectations. Thus he was at laſt prevail'd with to ſign the Treaty, which was alſo ſubſcrib'd by the Ambaſſador, as Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary from the <hi>Regency</hi> of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> whither he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to haſten the departure of the Fleet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Agreement concluded with <hi>Guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That wiſe Monarch had eſtabliſh'd his Authority on ſuch ſolid Foundations, that he neither dreaded the Murmuring of the People nor the Diſſatisfaction of the Nobility nor cou'd the united Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of all his Subjects have engag'd him in that Deſign, if he had not been afraid that the <hi>Hanſe-Towns</hi> wou'd have enter'd into a Treaty with the <hi>Danes.</hi> He knew that <hi>Norbi</hi> was not in a condition to oppoſe the Force of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and that he might eaſily find an opportunity to cruſh ſo feeble an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but he was ſenſible that 'twou'd be a diſſicult Task to expel the <hi>Danes,</hi> if they ſhou'd take this occation to make themſelves Maſters of the Iſland. In order to the execution of the Deſign he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, he commanded the Troops that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that Expedition to march, without nolſe, towards the Port of <hi>Calmar,</hi> which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </p>
               <p>The General landed without oppoſition at the Head of Eight thouſand Men, and in leſs than 15 Days made himſelf Maſter of all <hi>Gothland,</hi> except <hi>Wisbi,</hi> the Capital City, and the only fortifi'd Place in the Iſland, which he inveſted. <hi>Norbi</hi> ſurpriz'd at ſo unexpected an Attack, and finding himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reſiſt the power of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> ſet up King <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Colors in the higheſt place of the Town, and at the ſame time ſent one of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to that Prince, offering to acknowledge him as Sovereign, if he wou'd aſſiſt him with ſome Troops to oppoſe the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Invaſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe Propoſals were very welcom to <hi>Frederic;</hi> for tho' he had not look'd upon <hi>Gothland</hi> as a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the Crown of <hi>Denmark,</hi> 'twas his Intereſt, according to the uſual policy of all Sovereigns, to curb the growing Power of a neighbouring Prince. He was glad of any opportunity to ſtop the rapid progreſs of that young Conqueror, and wou'd have willingly ſent <hi>Norbi</hi> the Aſſiſtance he deſir'd; but the Fleet of <hi>Lubeck</hi> and of the reſt of the <hi>Hanſe Towns</hi> kept the Sea, and he was afraid of engaging in a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign War, at a time when he had reaſon to ſear a Domeſtick Invaſion, in order to the Reſtauration of <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> whom the Emperor had ſelemnly receiv'd under his Protection.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations made him chuſe rather to try the effect of a Negotiation, than to hazard a Rupture with ſo potent a Neighbour: And in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of that Deſign, he ſint an Ambaſſa dor to <hi>Libeth,</hi> to complain of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62547:117"/>and to deſire the <hi>Regency</hi> to imploy their Intereſt with that Prince to oblige him to withdraw his Forces out of an Iſland that did not belong to him. <hi>Frederic</hi> was not ignorant of the League which that <hi>Republic</hi> had made with <hi>Guſtavus:</hi> But to prevent the ill Conſequences of that Treaty, his Ambaſſador had Orders to repreſent to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> that 'twas their Intereſt to put a timely ſtop to the prevailing power of <hi>Sweden;</hi> that <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was a daring and couragious Prince, who wou'd infallibly endeavour to make his Conqueſts as boundleſs as his Ambition, if his Deſigns were not prevented by a ſeaſonable Oppoſition; that the Sovereignty of the Iſle of <hi>Gothland</hi> was an undoubted Right of the Crown of <hi>Denmark;</hi> that <hi>Norbi</hi> was intruſted with the Government of it by <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> II. and that ſince he was willing to ſubmit to his lawful Sovereign, the King his Maſter cou'd not refuſe to protect his own Subject, and to defend that Iſland to the utmoſt of his power, as a Territory that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to his Crown. He added, that his Majeſty wou'd ſubmit his Right to the Judgment of the <hi>Hanſe-Towns,</hi> rather than diſturb the Peace of the North, and that he was willing the Iſland ſhou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſequeſter'd in the Hands of the <hi>Regency</hi> of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> till the Controverſy betwixt him and <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> ſhou'd be decided by a ſinal Sentence.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrates of that City were eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to embrace a Propoſal, which if it ſhou'd take effect, wou'd not only ſecure 'em from the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, but free 'em from the Obligation of keeping a Fleet at Sea to cover the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Conqueſts. They were extreamly pleas'd with the <hi>Sequeſtration,</hi> and reſolv'd rather to be at the Charge of maintaining a Garriſon in the Iſland, than to ſuffer it to fall into the Hands of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> who might one Day make uſe of that opporiunity to diſturb their Trade, and to render himſelf more abſolute in the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62547:117"/>Thus the <hi>Regency</hi> concluded a ſecret Treaty with <hi>Frederic</hi>'s Ambaſſador, by which they oblig'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to open a free paſſage to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Succers. 'Twas alſo agreed, that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſhou'd ſend an Ambaſſador to <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> to complain of his Expedition againſt the Iſle of <hi>Gothland;</hi> and that his Envoy ſhou'd be follow'd by Ambaſſadors from the <hi>Hanſe-Towns,</hi> who ſhou'd offer their Mediation, and declare War againſt either of the two contending Parties that ſhou'd refuſe to come to an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
               <p>Immediately the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Forces were order'd to Embark, and enter'd the Port of <hi>Wisbi</hi> without any oppoſition from the Fleet of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and ſoon after the Ambaſſador of that Town arriv'd at <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi> to expoſtulate with <hi>Guſtavus</hi> in the Name of the King his Maſter, for beſieging a Place in his Dominions without declaring War againſt him. At the ſame Time the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>Hanſe-Towns</hi> came to propoſe a Truce, and to deſire an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view betwixt the two Kings at <hi>Malnogen.</hi> They offer'd the Mediation of their Maſters, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd the Interview in ſo peremptory a manner, that <hi>Guſtavus</hi> perceiv'd he muſt either ſubmit to that Expedient, or expect immediately the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an open War.</p>
               <p>Thus fearing to be Aſſaulted by ſo potent a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, he was forc'd to divert the threatning Storm by conſenting to the conditions that were propos'd to him. To prevent any Suſpicion of Treachery, <hi>Frederick,</hi> who was Maſter of the Place appointed for the Interview, ſent Four Senators, and Six of the moſt conſiderable Lords in <hi>Denmark,</hi> to remain at <hi>Stockholm</hi> as Hoſtages, during the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the two Kings. <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was ſenſible of the danger to which he expos'd himſelf, but he was ſo afraid of irritating the <hi>Hanſe-Towns,</hi> and ſo deſirous to make the <hi>Danes</hi> themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62547:118"/>his Title to the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> that he reſolv'd at all Adventures to purſue his intended Journey. He repair'd to <hi>Malmogen,</hi> accompanied with the Great Marſhal <hi>Tureiohanſon,</hi> and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Senators, after he had receiv'd another ſafe Conduct from <hi>Frederick,</hi> and the ſecurity of the <hi>Harſe-Towns</hi> for the ſafety of his Perſon; tho' it may be doubted whether any ſecurity can be given for a King, when he is in the Dominions of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
               <p>The reciprocal pretenſions of the two Crowas to the Iſle of <hi>Gothland</hi> were the Subject of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
<note place="margin">September.</note> The matter was debated on both ſides with a great deal of heat; and each party produc'd their reſpective Titles. <hi>Bildius,</hi> High Chamberlain to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Tureiohanſon,</hi> for <hi>Guſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavus,</hi> urg'd the Claims and defended the Rights of their Maſters: But in the Progreſs of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference the Great Marſhal betray'd the Cauſe and Intereſt of the Crown of <hi>Sweden.</hi> He cou'd not without a ſecret envy behold the Power and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe two Princes gave one another reciprocal marks of Eſteem and Reſpect, notwithſtanding the differences that reign'd between 'em.

               </p>
               <p>Some of the Senators and Officers of the Army, who had the largeſt ſhare in his Conſidence and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, took this occaſion to conjure him that he wou'd not longer delay the Ceremony of his <hi>Coronation.</hi> To convince him of the importance and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of their deſire they told him that 'twas but too probable the Succeſs of his Arms and the Glory of his Victories had procur'd him the Envy and Jealouſy of his Neighbors, and perhaps alſo the ſecret hatred of ſome Great Perſons in his own Kingdom; and that if either of 'em cou'd obtain their deſire he wou'd be leſs Fortunate and Happy. They added that there were ſeveral Lords in <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> who pretended they cou'd hardly look upon him as their Sovereign, becauſe he had not yet receiv'd the Crown; and concluded that the Ceremony of his <hi>Coronation</hi> was abſolutely neceſſary for the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62547:119"/>Eſtabliſhment of his Authority, and the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Title, that neither his Foreign nor Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic Enemies might entertain the leaſt hope of ſeeing any diſadvantageous alteration in his Fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was not ignorant of the Importance and Neceſſity of that Ceremony in an <hi>Elective</hi> Kingdom: But nothing cou'd ſhake the reſolution he had taken to put off his Coronation till he had Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted thoſe ſecret deſigns, without which he thought he cou'd neither ſettle his Authority nor ſecure the Happineſs of his Reign. 'Tis true, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd as Sovereign, and the Army was at his diſpoſal: But he was not Maſter of a ſufficient Fund to carry on a War. The Revenues of the Crown were either Alienated or Uſurp'd, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Taxes was reputed Tyrannical, the <hi>Commons</hi> were reduc'd to extream Poverty, and the <hi>Nobility</hi> exhauſted by a long and Expenſive War. On the contrary, the <hi>Clergy</hi> was Rich and Powerful, eſpecially the <hi>Biſhops</hi> who had ſeiz'd on the Principal Forts and part of the Revenues of the Crown. He knew that theſe Prelates were always very careful to make the Prince take a Solemn Oath, on the day of his Coronation, to preſerve and maintain all their Priviledges: And he was ſo far from intending either to take or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form an Oath of that Nature, that he was firmly reſolv'd to Abrogate and Cancel all thoſe Priviledges, which he look'd upon either as forc'd and involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Grants, or unjuſt Uſurpations of the Lands and Revenues of the Crown.</p>
               <p>After he had, in a very obliging manner, thank'd theſe Lords for the Zeal they expreſs'd for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, he told 'em that the Ceremony of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation con'd not be perform'd without a vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; that there were other more preſſing occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for Mony that were abſolutely neceſſary for the Preſervation of the State; that he had receiv'd
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62547:120"/>advice of the daily increaſe of <hi>Chriſtern</hi>'s Forces and Party; that the Emperor ſeem'd reſolv'd to re-eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh that Prince in the poſſeſſion of his former Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; that 'twas uncertain whether the Forces deſign'd for that Expedition wou'd invade <hi>Sweden</hi> or <hi>Denmark;</hi> that twas abſolutely impoſſible to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Deſcent without an Army by Land, and a Fleet at Sea; that he was wholly deſtitute of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to raiſe Forces and make other neceſſary Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that 'twas well known he had Mortgag'd his own Eſtate to expel the <hi>Danes</hi> out of the Kingdom; that he had lately melted down the Plate that belong'd to the Crown to pay the Charge of the Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Gothland</hi> which was thought to be of ſo great Importance for the ſecurity and freedom of Trade, and that conſidering the extream miſery of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People and the Poverty of the Nobility after ſo long a War, 'twas high time to demand a Subſidy of the Clergy, who were actually in poſſeſſion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one half of the Lands and Revenues of the Kingdom, and perhaps made their Coure to King <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> in private, on the ſcore of their never having contributed to the ſupport of his Enemies. He did not then think fit to give 'em a clearer view of his ſecret Intentions, but contented himſelf with telling 'em that 'twas the part and ought to be the care of his Friends, and eſpecially of thoſe who had ſet him upon the Throne, to furniſh him with ſufficient Power and Authority to maintain the Honor of the Poſt to which they had advanc'd him, inſtead of flattering him with the vain ſhow of an empty Ceremony.</p>
               <p>Afterwards be open'd his mind more freely to <hi>Larz Anderſon,</hi> the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> who was a Perſon of an obſcure Birth, but full of Ambition, of a vaſt and ſoaring Genius, cunning and cloquent and bold in Council. He was Maſter of a very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Invention in contriving Projects and Expedients,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62547:120"/>and his Mind was always full of great Deſigns. In his Youth he enter'd into Ecclefiaſtical Orders, and the Intereſt of his Friends joyn'd to his own Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties procur'd him the Dignity of <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> of the Church of <hi>Stregnez.</hi> He had alſo ſome proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of obtaining the Biſhoprick, for there were ſome who Voted for him at the Election; but he was ſo diſcourag'd by the Rubs he met with in that Way to Preferment, that he reſolv'd to try his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in another Road, and left the <hi>Church</hi> for the <hi>Court,</hi> were his Merit was quickly taken notice of, and procur'd him the Eſteem of <hi>Guſtavus.</hi> His skill in the Laws of the Country, and his Reſentment againſt the Clergy for excluding him from a Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick were ſufficient Qualifications to recommend him to the Favour of that Prince, who wanted a proper Inſtrument to humble an Order of Men whom he both fear'd and ſuſpected. That wiſe Monarch having found ſo fit a Perſon for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting of his Deſigns, gave him ſeveral diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marks of his Eſteem and of the Conſidence he plac'd in him, and advanc'd him to the Dignity of <hi>Chancellor.</hi> At laſt perceiving that his Friends urg'd him with ſo much earneſtneſs to haſten the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his <hi>Coronation,</hi> he told that Miniſter that he cou'd not look upon himſelf as Sovereign of <hi>Sweden,</hi> ſo long as the Biſhops were Maſters of ſo many Forts and retain'd the Poſſeſſion of thoſe Lands and Revenues which his Predeceſſors had alienated from the Crown to enrich the ſecular and regular Clergy. But at the ſame time he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd that he was afraid the leaſt Attempt upon the Priviledges of the Church wou'd occaſion new diſorders in the State, and that the <hi>Swedes</hi> out of their blind Obedience and Reſpect to their Spiritual Guides, wou'd accuſe him of profaneneſs for chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging his own property, and imagine him to be Guilty of a Crime againſt Religion for ſeizing on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62547:121"/>thoſe Lands and Treaſures, which they believ'd were conſecrated to God, tho' they ſerv'd only to maintain the Luxury and Vanity of idle and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons, who were always ready to ſacrifice the public Intereſt to their Ambition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon,</hi> who was poſſeſs'd with the new Doctrin that was propagated by <hi>Luther,</hi> and perhaps look'd upon <hi>Religious Controverſies</hi> as mere <hi>Philoſophical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems,</hi> endeavour'd, like a politic Courtier, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Maſter in a Deſign, which he perceiv'd was agreeable to him. He told him, that he ſaw no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he ſhou'd make the leaſt ſcruple of obliging the Clergy to contribute for the Defence of the Kingdom, and even in caſe of neceſſity of ſeizing thoſe Lands or Revenues which they poſſeſs'd by vertue of Legacies or Donations; that the <hi>Church</hi> was not confin'd to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> but included the whole Body of the <hi>Faithful;</hi> that in the pure and unſpotted Infancy of the Church, and in thoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Days when that Name was common to the whole Aſſembly of Chriſtians, thoſe Riches and Revenues that are at preſent appropriated to the <hi>Clergy</hi> were poſſeſs'd in Common by the <hi>People,</hi> who beſtow'd 'em on public Uſes, and eſpecially for the Relief of the Poor; that the Name of <hi>Church</hi> was afterwards claim'd by the <hi>Clergy</hi> as their peculiar Privilege, that under the ſpecious pretext of that Title they might make themſelves Maſters of thoſe Revenues, of which they were only the Stewards and Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; that the Eſtates and Revenues of the <hi>Laity</hi> ought to be reputed the Patrimony of the Church as well as thoſe of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> that the Clergy was the ſmalleſt part of the Church, and ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute proportionably for the ſecurity and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Government by which they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected. That he acknowledg'd 'twou'd be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to find out ſome other more plauſible Pretences than the Good of the State, to prevent an Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62547:121"/>of the People; who were commonly poſſeſs'd both by the Regular and Secular Clergy, that all Attempts upon their Temporalties ſtrike at Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf. That, to fruſtrate their Claims, he muſt take advantage of <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Reformation,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan then to take Root in the Kingdom; and by the help of his Doctrin, which equally invaded the Temporal Power and the exceſſive Wealth of the Clergy, he might afterwards ſeize the Forts that were in the Hands of the Biſhops, and re-unite to the Crown all the Lands that were alienated by his Predeceſſors, with more Zeal than Policy.</p>
               <p>That Pope <hi>Leo</hi> X. had indeed condemn'd <hi>Luther,</hi> but it was well known that famous Doctor was only odious to the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> becauſe he boldly and publickly cenſur'd its great Corruption and Abuſes; and that his Opinions, which might paſs for indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent among other Nations, as long as they were not condemn'd by the Church in a <hi>General Council,</hi> were in the mean time of the greateſt Importance for the ſettling of his Power in <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his Deſign.</p>
               <p>That the People, having their Minds prepar'd and poſſeſs'd by <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctors, wou'd ſee with great ſatisfaction the Clergy ſtript of their great Eſtates, eſpecially if care were taken at the ſame time to eaſe the People of the heavy Taxes. That one of the beſt Expedients wou'd be to reſtore to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try the Lands given away by their Anceſtors to the Church, and that they wou'd never be tempted to oppoſe a Doctrin that ſhou'd bring ſo great a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to their Families. That the greateſt part of the <hi>Monks</hi> lookt upon their <hi>Monaſteries</hi> as diſmal, tho' ſtately Priſons; and many of 'em would be glad to quit 'em, and embrace a Religion which reſtor'd 'em to all the Rights of Civil Society. That the inferior Clergy wou'd joyfully take hold of that occaſion to free themſelves from the Vows of <hi>Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62547:122"/>and exchange their ſcandalous <hi>Concubinage</hi> for lawful <hi>Matrimony.</hi> That the Biſhops alone, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt powerful and moſt concern'd in that Change, would probably oppoſe it; but that things were in a better poſture than in the Reign of King <hi>Canutſon,</hi> there being no Biſhops in <hi>Sweden</hi> in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to make War againſt their Sovereign; and, if they ſhou'd obſtinately perſiſt in the old Religion, it might perhaps be an Advantage to him. That their Number was inconſiderable, and 'twould be no difficult matter, under ſpecious Pretences, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or baniſh 'em; whereas, if they embrace <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> they might pretend, by marrying, to erect their Biſhopricks into ſecular Principalities, and conſequently fruſtrate him of the main Benefit he cou'd expect from the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Doctrin in his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>That after all, the Archbiſhop and Primate <hi>John Magnus</hi> was a timorous and wavering Prelate, and a Man of no Intereſt, who probably wou'd think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf happy, tho' with the loſs of part of his Eſtate, to be excuſed from imbracing the predominant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Kingdom. That the Biſhops of <hi>Stregnez</hi> and <hi>Weſteras,</hi> whom he had newly preferred to thoſe two rich Benefices, were of mean Extraction, and of too little Credit among the People to dare to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Will; and that the Biſhops of <hi>Vexio</hi> and <hi>Aboo,</hi> knew little of the ſtate of the Controverſy betwixt the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and had no great mind to dive into that Matter. That thoſe Prelates were illiterate Men, and ſuch as wou'd be affected with nothing ſo much as the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening of their Revenues. That their irregular Lives and Converſations had drawn ſuch a Scandal upon 'em as wou'd make it inconſiſtent with their Intereſt to thwart the Deſigns of their Sovereign, but wou'd rather incline 'em to imbrace any Offer that ſhou'd not oblige 'em to forſake their Pleaſures.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62547:122"/>So there remain'd only the Biſhops of <hi>Lincopine</hi> and <hi>Scara</hi> who might oppoſe his Deſigns; two Prelates really infatuated with their Dignity, jealous of all their Rights, wedded to their own Opinions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd ſtill to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Faction, notwithſtanding all King <hi>Chriſtiern</hi>'s Cruelties, and the moſt like to blind the People with a plauſible pretence of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the Defence of the true Religion. But when <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> ſhou'd be once receiv'd by the States of the Realm, by the plurality of Voices, 'twou'd be an eaſy thing to make the Reſiſtance of thoſe Biſhops a Crime of State, and to baniſh 'em out of the Kingdom, with all ſuch as ſhould appear moſt ſtifly bent for the preſervation of the ancient Religion. To which he added, That he was not ignorant of the great Difficulties which always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Infancy of Governments and Empires; but that thoſe very Princes, who meet with oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſiſtance in the beginning of their Reigns, are at laſt commonly reſpected and lookt upon as the Fathers of their Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> cou'd not but reliſh thoſe Reaſons of State, that were ſo agreeable to the ſecret Scheme he had laid for the ſecuring of his Government. He foreſaw the Emperor's Credit with the Pope wou'd hinder his Holineſs from declaring in his behalf, and therefore thought 'twou'd be expedient to pull down his Authority in <hi>Sweden,</hi> and that nothing cou'd be more conducive to that end than <hi>Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm.</hi> He therefore eaſily ſuckt in thoſe Tenents, which perhaps he lookt upon but as the Reſult of ſome Diſputations among Divines; and thought at the ſame time, he might reaſonably imbrace that Party which ſeemed moſt favourable to the ſettling of his <hi>Regal Power,</hi> which moſt Sovereigns either do not or, will not diſtinguiſh from the <hi>Good of the State.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:62547:123"/>
               <p>The King wou'd have willingly declar'd in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> but that the Change of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was not a ſufficient Ground for him to compaſs his Deſigns; and beſides, a ſudden Change might have prov'd of very ill conſequence. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſafeſt for his unſettl'd Power, to ſee the Change begun by the People, and that he ſhou'd ſeem after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to embrace this Doctrin out of meer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to his Subjects. But all the <hi>Swedes</hi> had not the ſame Inclination to thoſe new Opinions as the King had, nor ſo preſſing an Intereſt to change their Religion. <hi>Guſtavus</hi> foreſaw, that this Change wou'd not be the Work of one Year, by reaſon of the great and apparent Obſtacles that muſt be firſt overcome.</p>
               <p>He was not ignorant, there wou'd be a great number of eminent Perſons in the Realm, and even in his own Court, that wou'd oppoſe his Enterpriſe and quit his Intereſt, upon the very firſt ſtep he ſhould make to aboliſh the ancient Religion. And, on the other hand, he cou'd not endure to be charg'd with the care and defence of the State, while the ſtrongeſt Forts, which properly belong'd to the Crown, and the greateſt part of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Kingdom, were in the hands of thoſe who often imploy'd 'em only to curb the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Power, and to favour the Enemies of the State. He choſe rather, it ſeems, to expoſe himſelf to the iſſue of a Civil War, and even to venture his Crown, than to Reign ſo precariouſly; or rather he ſaw himſelf ſo potent and reſpected by his People, that he thought it not at all hazardous to re-unite to the Crown a part of the Church-Lands, under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence of a Reformation, and of the publick Good.</p>
               <p>In ſo great a Deſign, and ſo very nice a Juncture, <hi>Guſtavus</hi> ſhew'd himſelf an able and great Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian. He took great care to conceal his Thoughts
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62547:123"/>as to <hi>Luther</hi>'s Opinions; but at the ſame time gave ſecret Inſtructions to Chancellor <hi>Anderſon,</hi> not only to protect, as it were without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Olaus Petri</hi> and the other <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctors, but alſo to invite others from the Univerſities of <hi>Germany,</hi> that <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> might make the quicker progreſs thro' the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olaus,</hi> and the other <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctors, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd of the Chancellor's Protection, labour'd with great application to eſtabliſh their Doctrin, which they daily explain'd in their Sermons with unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Zeal. Moſt of theſe new Doctors ſurpalt the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Clergy in Learning and Elequence, to which they added a certain appearance of ſtrictneſs in their Lives and Converſations, which always attends the firſt Heats of a new-broach'd Religion. Theſe Men were heard with great ſatisfaction by the common People, who are always greedy of Novelties that put 'em to no charge, and tend to the leſſening of the Power of their ſpiritual Governors. The Credit they got inſenſibly among the Vulgar, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them the Attention and Favour of the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and the prime Nobility, who were glad to ſee the Biſhops humbled.</p>
               <p>While theſe Doctors endeavor'd to propagate the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrin by their Sermons, <hi>Guſtavus</hi> labour'd hard to find out ſome ſpecious Pretences to overthrow the Temporal Power of the Biſhops and Clergy. Immediately he ſell upon the Eccleſiaſticks of the ſecond Order, and iſſu'd out ſeveral Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Prieſts and in behalf of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the Laity might be oblig'd, by Intereſt, to favor theſe encroachments upon the Clergy, and that the People might be accuſtom'd, by degrees, to ſee the Privileges of the Clergy abrogated.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts in that Kingdom exacted, as it were a Tribute of the People, upon certain publick Sins, and with great rigor extorted conſiderable Fines

By one of the King's Declarations this Right was taken away, and the Prieſts were prohibited to exact ſuch Impoſitions for the future. By another Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Prieſts were forbidden to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate either their private Enemies, or their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The Truth is, the Biſhops and their Officials had ſo far over-ſtretch'd the Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as to appropriate to themſelves all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the Nation, that had the leaſt relation to Religion: An Oath made in a Treaty, the Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a Clergy-man which was oftentimes begg'd, the leaſt Difference in a Contract of Marriage, were Grounds ſufficient to remove a Cauſe from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Courts of Juſtice; which made the Clergy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and formidable. <hi>Guſtavus</hi> therefore abrogated that Juriſdiction entirely, under pretext that the Examination of Suits was not conſiſtent with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Functions of Clergy-men; and by the ſame Declaration commanded the Clergy, that they ſhou'd bring their Differences before the ſecular Judges, to whom he committed the Cognizance and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Cauſes.</p>
               <p>At laſt he publiſh'd a Declaration againſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops themſelves, by which they were expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden for the future to appropriate to themſelves the Eſtates and Succeſſion of the Clergy-men of their reſpective Dioceſſes, to the prejudice of their lawful Heirs; and commanded 'em to produce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Senate, the Titles by vertue of which they exacted Fines and Confiſcations. Thus <hi>Guſtavus</hi> iſſu'd out Declarations one after another, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to the progreſs of <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the Curioſity of all his Subjects, and made 'em ſpeak every one according to his private Intereſt or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62547:124"/>Inclination. The Nobility and Gentry, without examining the new-preach'd Doctrin, applauded the King for weakning the Power of the Clergy, which was become ſo odious; and ſome of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Perſons in the Kingdom declar'd publickly in favor of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> hoping by this new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin to recover thoſe Eſtates which their Anceſtors had given away for the Foundation of ſo many rich Monaſteries, of which the Kingdom was full.</p>
               <p>Thoſe even among the People who had ſome knowledge of public Affairs were not diſpleas'd to ſee the Power of the Clergy moderated, or at leaſt part of their many Extorſions aboliſhed, the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which was attributed to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> under the plauſible Names of Tithes, Indulgences and Alms. But that which gave 'em the greateſt ſatisfaction, was, that the King had put a ſtop to the litigious Proceedings of the Biſhops Officials, and other Miniſters who oppreſs'd the Kingdom, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of Correction and Eccleſiaſtical Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But both the Regular and Secular Clergy grew very uneaſy at this Attempt againſt their Authority, nor cou'd they endure to be thus diſturb'd in the poſſeſſion of their Rights and Priviledges. The King, ſlighting their Diſcontent, put his Troops into Winter Quarters upon their Lands, which none of his Predeceſſors had ever attempted to do, and quarter'd his Horſe in the Abbies and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, pretending that the Peaſants were ruin'd, but in effect to keep the Monks in awe by the preſence and terror of his Soldiers. His Officers of Juſtice brought into Queſtion, by his Order, the Title of the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> to the rich Monaſtery of <hi>Griphyſholm,</hi> who own'd the King's Anceſtors to be the Founders of it, and they were oblig'd to prove the Donation or Acquiſition of the Lands they injoy'd. Having loſt their Title, they had recourſe to Preſcription;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62547:125"/>alledging, that they held the beſt part of their Lands from the Piety of the Lords of <hi>Vaſa,</hi> but had loſt their Title during the Confuſions and Troubles of the Civil Wars. The King, without regarding the Preſcription, re-united to his own Eſtate the Lands of this Monaſtery, which belong'd origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to his Family; and expell'd the Monks out of it, under pretext that it was built upon his own Ground. But perhaps the true Reaſon was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they denied him Admittance into their Houſe, when he was Perſecuted by <hi>Chriſtiern.</hi> And 'tis not improbable that he took this way to feel the Pulſe of the People, and at the ſame time to kindle in the Nobility a Deſire to follow his Example, by appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating to themſelves the Lands that were alienated by their Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctors, to make their Court, told the chief Lords of the Realm, that they had been gulled too long both by the Regular and Secular Clergy; that Purgatory was a Net in which they caught the beſt part of their Wealth, and that with this pious Cheat the Monks eſpecially had bubbl'd 'em of many large Poſſeſſions they injoy'd with ſo much effeminacy. That they ought to re-enter their ancient Patrimony as an uſurp'd Eſtate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being deterr'd by an imaginary Fire. And, tho' there were ſuch a Thing as Purgatory, yet 'twas but a Weakneſs to think, that the Rigor of it cou'd be allay'd by the Prayers, or Songs of a few Monks.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time there was publiſh'd by <hi>Olaus</hi> a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the New Teſtament into the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Language, being but a bare Tranſlation of that which <hi>Luther</hi> had publiſh'd in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue. <hi>Olaus</hi>'s Diſciples fail'd not to recommend the Reading of that Work in their Sermons, preaching the great Neceſſity and Value of it, and ſpreading this Book, with great care, over the whole Kingdom. They did not queſtion
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62547:125"/>but the People, and Women eſpecially, wou'd be pleaſed to ſee themſelves enabl'd to paſs their Verdict upon Points of Religion; and that they wou'd ſooner yield to the Authority of ſome places of Scripture, Tranſlated according to the Doctrin Preach'd to 'em, than have any thoughts of calling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Queſtion the Faithfulneſs of the Tranſlation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Biſhops ſaw plainly that <hi>Olaus</hi>'s Tranſlation came from the ſame Hand that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded their Priviledges, and that their Religion was inſulted for no other end than to pull down their Dignities. They obſerv'd in the King's Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Affairs a Series of Projects and Deſigns, and at the ſame time an inſuperable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In ſhort, they reſolv'd to diſſemble as he did. But they went in a Body to attend his Majeſty, and pray'd him to order that <hi>Olaus</hi>'s Followers might be brought to their Trials as Notorious Hereticks. The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> who ſpoke in the name of all the reſt, repreſented to the King, that <hi>Claus</hi>'s Tranſlation was but a Copy of <hi>Luther's,</hi> condemned by the Holy See, and by the moſt famous Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Europe.</hi> Then he ſuggeſted to him in a few words, but with a great deal of reſpect and moderation, that the Church-Immunities, and even the Priviledges of the People, had been violated by his late Declarations, which they were ſenſible he was adviſed to publiſh by the Enemies of their Religion. He therefore pray'd him in the name of the whole Clergy to call 'em in, and exhorted him in pathetick and reſpectful Terms to be the Protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of the Religion of the State, and of its Miniſters.</p>

They ſaw that they had ſet a wiſe and mighty Prince upon the Throne who was reſolv'd to ruin their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and was ſo much the more terrible becauſe of his Dexterity in concealing his Hatred and Deſigns under the ſpecious pretence of the public Good. The Archbiſhop of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal</hi> brought his Complaints to the King, and told him, that his Officers committed ſuch Depredations in all the Churches, as were ſcarce to be fear'd from the moſt outragious Hereticks or Fanaticks.</p>
               <p>The King, having thus at laſt pull'd off the Mask, anſwer'd the Biſhop with an Ai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of Authority, that what had been ſeiz'd by his Order wou'd be better imploy'd for the Defence of the Realm, than for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62547:129"/>maintaining the Grandeur and Pride of the Clergy. After theſe words he diſmiſs'd him, and wou'd not give him a longer Audience.</p>
               <p>The King's Anſwer, and the Violence of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, did extremely exaſperate moſt of the zealous Catholicks of the Kingdom. The Clergy-men, but the Monks eſpecially, exclaim'd againſt him with all the extravagance of Spite and Fury, ſcattering ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous Libels among the People, in which they branded him with the odious Character of a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and of an excommunicated Prince: And even ſome of the hotteſt of 'em propos'd to make void his Election. The Mob, that were eaſily ſet on Fire by any pretext of Religion, join'd with 'em in the heat of their Reſentment. The Peaſants, among others, cou'd not indure to part with their Bells, and the Silver Croſſes of their Churches, which often made the moſt eſſential part of their Worſhip. Theſe wild and ſavage People were the fitteſt Tools to carry on the Deſigns of the Prieſts, who perſwaded 'em that theſe Innovations tended directly to the ſubverſion of Religion and Liberty. Some of 'em took up Arms, purſu'd the King's Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and having recover'd their Bells, brought 'em back to their Villages in a kind of Triumph.</p>
               <p>A great Fair was yearly held near <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal</hi> about this time of the Year, with an extraordinary Concourſe of People from all the neighbouring Provinces. This was a ſort of Convention of the Eſtates for the Country People, who diſcourſed here of their Trade, of the Affairs of each Province, but eſpecially of the Differences that aroſe about the Preſervation of their Rights and Priviledges. The Malecontents, glad of this opportunity to ſtir up a Rebellion, did privately diſpoſe the chief of 'em to demand the Revocation of the laſt Decree of the Senate, as to the Tithes and Church-bells.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:62547:129"/>
               <p>The King had timely notice of their Deſigns by the ſecret Intelligencers whom he kept every where. The Mony he liberally diſtributed among 'em, made 'em pry into every Corner, and induſtriouſly pump out the greateſt Secrets. By theſe Spies he learnt, that the Country-people, animated by the Clergy, were reſolv'd to riſe up in Arms at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal</hi>-Fair, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs their Bells were ſpeedily reſtor'd.</p>
               <p>To prevent the threatening Danger, <hi>Guſtavus</hi> went immediately to the Fair, at the Head of a Body of Horſe; and by his unexpected Arrival ſurpriz'd the Mutineers, and put 'em into a great Conſternation. He ſpoke to 'em with a certain Air of Greatneſs and Authority, like a Prince that has a Right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and will be obey'd. He ask'd 'em, with a fierce Look, who had intruſted 'em with the Care of the Government, by what Authority they cenſured the Decrees of the Senate, and whether they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that the Biſhops and the whole Clergy were greater Enemies to their Country than the very <hi>Danes?</hi> Then, to gain 'em by the moſt winning and convincing Argument, he told 'em, that by the late Decree of the Senate, concerning the Tithes, to which he gave his Aſſent, 'twas plain the Eaſe of the People was his principal Aim; that to pay the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency</hi> of <hi>Lubeck</hi> in ſo preſſing a juncture of Affairs, 'twas thought more reaſonable to fleece a rich Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, than to over-burden the People with new Taxes and Impoſitions. He hop'd that this Diſcourſe wou'd have either frighten'd or wheedl'd 'em into a Compliance with his Deſires; but inſtead of that, the inſolent Multitude began to exclaim with a great deal of Violence, that they wou'd never ſuffer their Religion to be alter'd, nor their Bells and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate to be taken from 'em. The King, incens'd at their Audaciouſneſs, commanded his Men to fire upon the Mutineers; who, obſerving the poſture of his Horſe juſt going to give ſire, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ll upon their Knees,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62547:130"/>and begg'd his Majeſty's Pardon. The Ring-leaders of the Mutiny were ſecur'd, while the reſt hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Crowd, or eſcap'd in the Dark. In ſhort, they preſently diſpers'd, and retir'd with an awful Idea of a Prince who knew ſo well how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort Obedience.</p>
               <p>This mutinous Aſſembly was no ſooner diſpers'd by his Preſence, but a new Plot was laid to Dethrone him. A certain Groom call'd <hi>Hans,</hi> of the Pariſh of <hi>Biorchſtrat</hi> in the Province of <hi>Weſtmannia,</hi> form'd a Deſign infinitely above the meanneſs of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Afpiring to no leſs than a Crown, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonated the eldeſt Son of the deceaſed <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> tho' that young Prince died a Year before. He was perſwaded by ſome diſaffected People, that the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who were incens'd againſt <hi>Guſtavus</hi> and weary of his Government, wou'd chuſe rather to place him upon the Throne, than ſuffer any change in Religion.</p>
               <p>The Impoſtor was a handſom and bold Perſon: He ſpoke with a great deal of Freedom and Eaſe, and had a nobler Air than was ſuitable to his Birth or Education. He travell'd over all the Province of <hi>Dalecarlia,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Nils Steno;</hi> never appear'd but in the remoteſt Places, and ſuch as had the leaſt relation to the Court; nor did he long reſide in the ſame place. When he appear'd abroad, he was very Reſerv'd and full of Precaution; inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Guſtavus</hi> cou'd not indure the ſight of him, becauſe it check'd his Conſcience, and put him in mind of the Crown he had uſurp'd, to the prejudice of the Family to which he ow'd his Fortune and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement. Therefore that violent Prince cou'd never look upon him but with Eyes full of Fury; that he had ſeveral times attempted to Kill him; and that the Princeſs, his Mother, fearing the worſt, had advis'd him to retire.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:62547:130"/>
               <p>Then he ask'd the People, in a very moving and pathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Falling upon his Knees, he conjur'd the Peaſants to pray to God for the Soul of the Prince his Father, and to ſay each a <hi>Pater noſter</hi> in his behalf, while they were allow'd to believe a Purgatory. Then he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd againſt <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Government, calling him an Uſurper and an Heretic, that had renounc'd the Religion of his Anceſtors. And, whereas thoſe Peaſants were extremely jealous of their Cuſtoms, he charg'd him with Innovation for affecting a more ſtately Garb than his Predeceſſors, pretending that he deſign'd to alter the very Habit as well as the Religion of the Nation, and wou'd oblige all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to conſent to theſe unſufferable Changes.</p>
               <p>'Tis thought, the Biſhop of <hi>Lincopinc</hi> and the chief of the Clergy had a hand in this Conſpiracy, hoping by this means to raiſe ſuch a Commotion as might occaſion a Revolution in the Government. At leaſt 'tis certain, that that Biſhop, and thoſe of his Party, ſeem'd to believe that he was really the <hi>Adminiſtrator's</hi> Son, to give the greater Credit to the Impoſtor, who by the ſecret Protection of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and other Malecontents, ſaw himſelf in a ſhort time follow'd by a Crowd of Peaſants and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted Perſons, whoſe deſperate Condition made 'em ready to embrace the firſt opportunity of a Change.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> knew not whether to march againſt him, or neglect ſo groundleſs a Rumor; he was irreſolute for ſome time, and waver'd 'twixt Hope and Fear; for tho' he was ſenſible of the Danger of ſlighting the feebleſt Enemy, he was afraid leſt by ſhewing too viſible a Concern on this occaſion he ſhou'd ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gthen
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62547:131"/>the Party of the Impoſtor. At laſt he reſolv'd to deſire the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi>'s Widow to write to the <hi>Dalecarlians;</hi> and that Princeſs, in obedience to his Requeſt, aſſur'd 'em, by a Letter, that her Son died above a Year ago; that all the Inhabitants of <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi> who aſſiſted at his Funeral, were Witneſſes of his Death; and that ſhe had but one young Child living, of whoſe Education the King took as much care as if he were his own Son.</p>
               <p>This Letter had all the ſucceſs <hi>Guſtavus</hi> cou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; and the undeceiv'd Peaſants forſook their fictitious Prince, who, fearing that they wou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him up to the King, fled to <hi>Norway;</hi> where he found a new Protection, upon the Recommendation, of the Biſhops of <hi>Sweden</hi> to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them,</hi> by whom he was receiv'd and entertain'd as Prince of <hi>Sweden.</hi> By this Prelate's Intereſt the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor rais'd new Troops in that Kingdom, and by his own Inſinuations he perſuaded a Lady of the higheſt Quality there, that the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi> did rightly belong to him, and promis'd he wou'd one day raiſe her Daughter to the Dignity of a Queen. The Lady, dazel'd with the proſpect of a Crown, made her Tenants take up Arms in Defence of his Right, furniſh'd him with great Sums of Mony to begin the War, and preſented him with a Gold Chain of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Weight, as the Pledge of the Alliance ſhe wou'd contract with him.</p>
               <p>The King, upon Advice that the Impoſtor was preparing to return to <hi>Sweden,</hi> order'd a Body of Horſe to prevent him. At the ſame time he writ to <hi>Frederic</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> complaining of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection he gave, in his Dominions, to a notorious Cheat, proteſting he wou'd ſeek him out at the Head of his Army in the furtheſt Parts of <hi>Norway,</hi> if he were not ſpeedily expell'd out of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:62547:131"/>
               <p>That wiſe and politick Prince cou'd not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſecret Jealouſy, look upon the Union of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the Proſperity of <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Reign, and wou'd have been glad to ſee <hi>Sweden</hi> imbroil'd in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars by the Counterfeit <hi>Steno.</hi> But fearing a Storm from <hi>Sweden,</hi> when he expected every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Deſcent from <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> he ſent Orders to <hi>Hans</hi> to depart immediately out of his Dominions; and that unhappy Wretch fled from <hi>Norway</hi> to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock,</hi> a Free and Imperial City in <hi>Mecklemburg</hi> upon the <hi>Baltick. Guſtavus,</hi> having receiv'd advice of his Retreat, ſent to the Magiſtrates of that City requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em to deliver up the Impoſtor, and threaten'd to ſtop all their Ships that ſhou'd he found in his Ports, if they wou'd not comply with ſo juſt a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. The Magiſtrates of <hi>Roſtock,</hi> having no reaſon to protect ſuch an abandon'd Wretch, caus'd him to be Beheaded; by which Execution they put an end to <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s fears, and baffled all the Hopes of his diſſaffected Subjects.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Clergy had not publickly appear'd in this Revolt, yet the King was fully convinc'd that they wou'd have infallibly declar'd for the Impoſtor, if his Attempt had been attended with ſucceſs. He knew them to be his moſt dangerous Enemies, and that nothing but the Fear of his Power, kept them from open Rebellion. The Biſhops influenc'd the Curates and inferiour Clergy to keep the People ſteady in their ancient Religion, being ſenſible they muſt loſe the beſt part of their Revenues, aſſoon as <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> ſhou'd be eſtabliſh'd. Such powerful Motives as Religion and Self-Intereſt, put the whole Body of the Clergy into a ferment, and made them turn every Stone. The Monks, but eſpecially thoſe call'd <hi>Mendicant</hi> Frius, run thro' all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, under pretext of begging Bread for their Subſiſtence, but in effect to foment the Diſcontents of the People. They made ſure of their Friends,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62547:132"/>influenc'd their Devotoes, form'd Cabals in all the Villages, and ſpoke ſo diſreſpectfully of their Prince, as if their affected Zeal for the Defence of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, cou'd have juſtify'd the Spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
               <p>The King, being under ſome apprehenſion that the Clergy and thoſe Monks might at laſt occaſion ſome dangerous Revolt, reſolv'd to gain the Biſhops, and eſpecially the Heads and Superiors of the Religious Houſes, and to remove ſuch as wou'd not comply with his Deſigns. Moſt of the Superiors of the <hi>Mendicant</hi> Friars were <hi>Germans</hi> and Foreigners, all Doctors in the chief Univerſities of <hi>Germany,</hi> who were ſent by their Generals to viſit and govern the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Monaſteries. The King iſſued out a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, forbidding thoſe Foreigners to meddle with the Government of the Monks his natural Subjects, under pretence that being Subjects of the Emperor and other Princes who were Enemies to the Nation, they incited not only the Monks, but even the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, to Rebellious Practices. So that they were oblig'd immediately to leave the Kingdom, and the King took care to ſubſtitute in their Places ſuch Monks as were intirely devoted to the Court. This Declaration was follow'd by another, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the Viſits and too frequent Journies of the Monks. By this Edict they were not allow'd to go above twice a Year out of their Monaſteries, and to ſtay but a Fortnight each time to receive the Bounty and Alms of the People. This done, the King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himſelf to the Biſhops of <hi>Stregnez</hi> and <hi>Weſteras,</hi> who were his Creatures, and aſſur'd 'em, that in all theſe Proceedings he had no other Aim, than to ſee the Word of God obſerv'd in his Kingdom, and to baniſh all Superſtitions that a worldly Intereſt had introduc'd into religious Worſhip. He deſir'd 'em cheerfully to ſurrender the Fortreſſes that were in their Hands, promis'd to make 'em futable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62547:132"/>Returns, and to advance their Families to the principal and higheſt Dignities in the Kingdom. Upon which Declarations of his Affection and the Confidence he plac'd in 'em, they told him they ſhou'd always be ready to ſubmit to his Will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inquiring into the Reaſon of his Orders; imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that their Complaiſance cou'd not be reputed Criminal, ſo long as they did not openly profeſs thoſe Doctrins which they look'd upon as erroneous, eſpecially ſince they cou'd not oppoſe the King's Deſigns, without expoſing themſelves to his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But the Archbiſhop of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal</hi> reſiſted the Temptation, with a Reſolution that cou'd neither be ſhaken by Promiſes or Threats. His Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were ſeized, his Family perſecuted, and his Perſon for ſome time confined to a Convent at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> under pretence that he had a hand in the Impoſtor's Rebellion. In a word, none of thoſe indirect Perſecutions were omitted to which Princes uſually have Recourſe when they wou'd reclaim ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Subjects, that will not be reduc'd by gentler Methods. He anſwer'd thoſe who urged him to yield to the King's Will, that he was advanc'd to his Dignity without making the leaſt Intereſt for it; that King <hi>Guſtavus</hi> himſelf recommended him of his own accord, made an Intereſt for his Choice, and he cou'd not imagine that Prince ſhou'd expect from him, by way of Acknowledgment, that he ſhou'd ſo baſely betray his Dignity and Miniſtry. The King, finding him Inflexible, found out an honourable way to get rid of him, by conferring upon him the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Embaſſador. He was order'd forthwith to ſet out for <hi>Poland,</hi> and the King ſent him word that he ſhou'd receive his Diſpatches at <hi>Dantzie.</hi> The Archbiſhop apprehended preſently the Driſt of this Commiſſion, and lookt upon his Embaſſy as little better than a Baniſhment. However, he they'd the King's Orders with a great deal of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62547:133"/>and went for <hi>Dantzic,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1527"/> with his Brother <hi>Olaus Magnus.</hi> Where having waited ſome time (but in vain) for his Diſpatches and his Majeſty's Orders, and hearing that <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> got ground every Day in <hi>Sweden,</hi> he went to <hi>Rome</hi> to implore the Pope's Aſſiſtance, and inform his Holineſs of the Danger that threatned the Catholick Religion in <hi>Sweden,</hi> under ſo politick and ſo mighty a Prince.</p>
               <p>But the Pope was in ſo bad Circumſtances that he cou'd not take much notice of the Affairs of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Clement</hi> VII.</note> His extraordinary Ambition to advance and aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize his Family, made him enter the Year before into a League with <hi>Francis</hi> I. King of <hi>France,</hi> and the States of <hi>Venice, Florence</hi> and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> againſt the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. The Deſign of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy was to procure the Liberty of the Children of <hi>France</hi> who were then Hoſtages in <hi>Spain,</hi> to recover the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> to the Holy See, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Sforza</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Milan,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Liberty of <hi>Italy;</hi> in a word, to oppoſe the Power of the Emperor, who was grown formidable ever ſince the Battel of <hi>Pavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Prince was ſo incens'd againſt the Pope, whom he lookt upon as the Author of the League, that he rais'd a bloody War againſt him. But the War it ſelf was not ſo grievous to the Pope, as the Emperor's Exhortation to the Cardinals to ſummon a lawful Council for the Good of the Church, which wanted to be Reformed (as the Emperor was pleas'd to expreſs it) both in her Head and Members. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was extremely averſe to a Council, which he dreaded wou'd not only regulate the Papaal Power, but enter upon ſome Enquiry that might be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to his Perſon and Dignity. He was always reputed the natural Son of <hi>Julian de Medicis,</hi> till Pope <hi>Leo</hi> X. being of the ſame Family declar'd him Legitimate, upon the Information of his Mother's
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62547:133"/>Brother, and of certain Monks who depoſed that there was a Promiſe of Marriage, tho' ſuch an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was ſomewhat ſuſpicious in ſo nice an Affair. There was indeed no poſitive Law to exclude Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards from the Pontificate; but 'twas the common Opinion, that ſo eminent and holy a Dignity was inconſiſtent with ſo great a Blemiſh. The Pope therefore might juſtly fear, that the Emperor wou'd inſiſt upon it in a Council, and by his Authority colour it with a Pretext of Juſtice and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he knew that the Emperor had a Note in his Hands, which he had given to Cardinal <hi>Colouna</hi> in the Conclave, to purchaſe his Vote. Thus he ſaw himſelf in danger of being depos'd, as was <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thazar Coſſa,</hi> known during his Pontificate by the Name of <hi>John</hi> XXIII. and the rather, becauſe Pope <hi>Julius</hi> II. had iſſued out a ſtrict Bull, annulling and making void all Simoniacal Elections, and putting it out of the Power of the Cardinals, by a poſterior Conſent, to make 'em valid.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Charles</hi> V. did not ſo much aim at his Perſon, as the Principalities annex'd to his Dignity. His eagerneſs for a Council was only to get an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to raiſe him new Enemies, and to make him depend upon his pleaſure. He wou'd fain have had the Command of the Pope's Territories, which lay ſo convenient for him in that juncture of War for the Communication of the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> with the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the late League the Pope had made with his Enemies afforded him a plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to ſeize on 'em.</p>
               <p>He gave Orders to his Army to march into the Pope's Territories. His Troops beſieg'd, and took <hi>Rome</hi> by Storm, where they committed ſuch Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities as cou'd not be expected from Infidels. Both the Maſſacre and Plunder laſted ſeveral Days, the Virgins were raviſh'd in their Mothers Arm, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62547:134"/>at the foot of the very Altars,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1526"/> the Monuments of the Apoſtles and the Relics of the Saints were prophan'd by the Avarice and Inſolence of the Soldiers; the Cardinals and Prelates of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> were thrown into diſmal Dungeons, where they were perpetually alarm'd with the fear of an ignominious Death, to make 'em deliver up the Treaſures of the Church. The Pope himſelf was ſeiz'd and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd in the Caſtle of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> by the Emperor's Officers. And that Prince, who affected the religious Title of <hi>Catholick,</hi> deſign'd to ſend him to <hi>Spain,</hi> as he had done <hi>Francis</hi> I. that he might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the ſame time Triumph over the two great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> one Spiritual, and the other Temporal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> heard with a ſecret Joy the News of this War betwixt the Pope and the Emperor, but eſpecially of the amazing Succeſs of the laſt. He therefore reſolv'd to follow his Example, and to make uſe of this Juncture to give the fatal Blow to the Dignity of the Biſhops of his Realm. His Power was ſo great, that he feared no Rebellion; having a conſiderable number of Troops on foot, which made him formidable to his Enemies at home and abroad. Moſt of his Officers were Foreigners or <hi>Lutherans,</hi> all equally devoted both to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Fortune; the Senators were all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and the <hi>Danes</hi> his Allies.</p>
               <p>Thus whilſt all <hi>Europe</hi> dreaded his Power or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd his Greatneſs, he form'd a Deſign to take from the Liſhops all the ſtrong Holds that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Juriſdiction, and at the ſame time to make an exact Enquiry into all the Purchaſes or Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of both the Regular and Secular Clergy, ſince the Prohibition of King <hi>Canietſon.</hi> But above all he reſolv'd to get all his Declarations, and the Decree made in the Senate relating to the Tithes, confirm'd by the Eſtates of the Kingdom.</p>

               <p>In purſuance of this Reſolution he call'd a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Eſtates at <hi>Weſteras,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1527"/> and made uſe of his Authority in all the Provinces to influence the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch Deputies as might ſerve his turn. He ſent ſecret Orders to a certain number of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of War to be preſent at the Elections, under colour of ſoliciting for the Payment of the Troops. He himſelf follow'd 'em ſoon after, attended by all the Senators, and follow'd by a Crowd of Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; who ſhew'd his Greatneſs, and ſerved at the ſame time to maintain it.</p>
               <p>He began to diſcover his Intention in the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Treat which he gave the Biſhops, Senators, Deputies of Provinces, and all the Members of the Eſtates. The Officers of his Houſhold alter'd the uſual order of the Seats at Table: The chief Places were given to the Temporal Senators, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Biſhops, who claim'd that Honour by preſcription. And the ſame Precedency was given to the Gentry, who were plac'd above the Deputies of the inferior Clergy. By which alteration the King deſign'd to create a Difference betwixt the biſhop: and the Senators, and to make the Gentry approve his Intentions to humble the Clergy.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as the Biſhops and other Eccleſiaſtical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties roſe from Table, they retir'd in great diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent from the Hall, and even out of the Caſtle, and went to St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Church, where they ſhut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in. Being alone, and (as they thought) ſafe, they ask'd one another what might be the Reaſon of the publick Injury and Affront which the King had put upon 'em. The Biſhop of <hi>Lincopinc</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in the Aſſembly as being the firſt Suffragan to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> made a Speech to this effect, That they knew by their own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fience, that the King never did any publick Action, without ſome private Deſign; That this alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the prejudice of their Order, was but a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62547:135"/>forerunner of greater Perſecutions; That the Kings Declarations, the Decrees of the Senate, the Attempts of his Majeſtys Officers, his Power and his Armies, were ſo many Prognoſticks of the loſs of their Liberty, and the beſt part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues; That under the ſpecious Title of Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Country, he aſſum'd an abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, above the reach of the Laws; That he was reſolved to ſeize upon their Caſtles and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and afterwards deprive 'em of that ſhare in the Government which they had ſo long injoy'd; and that Religon it ſelf would be in great danger, if they did not reſolve vigorouſly to oppoſe the <hi>Lutherans.</hi>

He added, that in his Opinion the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ſhould contribute part of their Revenues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Defence of the Kingdom; and declared his readineſs to put his Caſtle into the King's Hands, who was better able to defend it againſt the Enemies of the State than a Clergy-Man.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Lincopinc</hi> could not hear that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates Diſcourſe without Indignation. He ask'd him in an angry Tone, whether he thought he could as Lawfully diſpoſe of his Church Lands as of his Patrimony, and that in behalf of a Heretick Prince, or one at leaſt who countenanced Hereſy. He tax'd him, that he ſpoke more like a Stateſman and a Courtier, than a true Biſhop, and, to ſoften thoſe hard and offenſive expreſſions, he conjur'd him with all earneſtneſs to ſtick to the Intereſts of his Brethren, and to A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62547:135"/>exhorted the whole Aſſembly to follow their Arch-Biſhops ſteps, who had generouſly withſtood both the Careſſes and Threats of the Court; telling them, that upon all ſuch Occaſions they were oblig'd to remember the Oath they had taken at their Conſecration, to venture their Lives in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Religion and the Rights and Privileges of their Churches. In a word, he omitted nothing that cou'd revive in their minds a true Epiſcopal Zeal, or convince them that the ſevereſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that cou'd be inflicted on 'em for an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical conſtancy or ſtedfaſtneſs would be far more glorious to 'em than all the favour of the Court.</p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe being pronounc'd with a great deal of heat, drew in the three other Biſhops, and all the other Eccleſiaſticks that Compos'd the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; ſo that it was reſolv'd, they were oblig'd to maintain to the utmoſt of their power the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues and Rights of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Church againſt all oppoſers. The Biſhops of <hi>Stregnez</hi> and <hi>Weſteras,</hi> as great Courtiers as they were, durſt not oppoſe ſo generous a motion; or perhaps were not ſorry to ſee their Brethren undertake, at their Perils, to Defend their Dignities. In ſhort, theſe Six Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops took a Solemn Oath to Defend with vigor the Rights and Priviledges of the Church againſt all the Attempts of the King. They made an Act to which they ſubſcrib'd, and which they cans'd to be ſign'd by all the reſt of the Clergy who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; then they hid it in a Tomb in the Church, leſt it ſhould fall into the King's hands.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Lincopinc</hi> endeavour'd alſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the favour of ſome powerful Lay-Patrons: He privately made ſure of <hi>Tureiohanſon</hi> the great Marſhal, whoſe Birth and Dignity gave him the next rank to the King; but theſe advantages were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcur'd by the defect of his Merit and by his Pride. He
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62547:136"/>talk'd perpetually of his Pedegree; and tho' he had neither Valour nor Courage, he fanſi'd that his Birth and Quality entitl'd him to the eſteem of all Mankind. The Biſhop begg'd his Protection for the Clergy and that was ground enough to obtain it. The Marſhal, was ſo over joy'd to ſee himſelf court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſo conſiderable a Party, that he made a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Promiſe, to maintain and ſupport the ancient Religion and its Miniſters. Beſides him, that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late gain'd ſome Lords of <hi>Weſt-Gothland,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Deputies of the Peaſants, who combin'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to oppoſe all the Attempts of the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day the Eſtates met, and the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour open'd the Seſſions with a pathetic Speech, upon the Exigences of the State. He told them from the King, that there was no Fund ſettl'd for the Payment of the Forces; that moſt of the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier places wanted to be Fortifi'd; that the Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals were unfurniſh'd, and that there were few Ships in the Ports. He forgot not to Alarm 'em with an account of King <hi>Chriſtiern</hi>'s preparations. He put 'em in mind of all the Cruelties which that Prince committed in the Kingdom, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the moſt diſmal colours, the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of that Kingdom under his Government. Beſides the Maſſacre of the Senate, he preſented 'em with a frightful Catalogue of all the Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Plunders, Aſſaſſinates, Burnings, Rapes, and other Enormous Barbarities that were Authoriz'd by a Prince who never gave himſelf the trouble to ſeek for any pretext to excuſe or cover his Crimes. A dreadful Time, when the Kingdom was become a Prey to Implacable Enemies, or to Treacherous and Rebellious Natives, more cruel than they, whoſe Credit and Rewards were more Intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than there very Treaſons and Villanies. He told 'em that when the Nation was in theſe deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62547:136"/>and hopeleſs circumſtances, the King alone formed, a generous deſign to deliver his Native Country. In order to which he had expos'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the greateſt Dangers; and, as he had not ſpar'd his life for their defence, ſo 'twas well known he had Mortgag'd all his Eſtate to carry on the War againſt the <hi>Danes.</hi> That by his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Conduct, the <hi>Swedes</hi> had at laſt Triumph'd over their Enemies; but that the ſame cruel Enemies were preparing for a new Invaſion with all the Forces of the Emperour, if ſpeedy care were not taken to oppoſe 'em. To which he added, that the Revenues of the Crown were ſo diminiſh'd by the Uſurpations of the Clergy, that they were ſcarce ſufficient to anſwer the Charge of the civil Liſt. That the Nobility and Gentry were alſo ruin'd by the imprudent Bounty of their Anceſtors. That it was plain, the Church of <hi>Sweden</hi> alone had the command of more Wealth, than the King, and all the other Eſtates of the Realm together. That the Biſhops had always made Religion ſubſervient to their Intereſt, and the Eſtabliſhing of their Authority; and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct means had made themſelves Maſters of the beſt Mannours and Principal Fortreſſes. That theſe Prelates, growing by degrees Richer and more Potent than their Sovereign had frequently revolted againſt their Princes. That their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had occaſion'd all the Civil and Foreign Wars, with which the Kingdom had been harraſs'd for near the ſpace of 120 Years. That they had ſeveral times call'd in the Enemies, and receiv'd 'em into their Forts, ſticking at no Treachery to compaſs their wicked Deſigns.</p>
               <p>That the Senate, ſenſible of the preſent Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and knowing how prejudical the exceſſive Power and Wealth of the Biſhops was to the Peace of <hi>Sweden,</hi> had wiſely ordain'd, that two Thirds
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62547:137"/>of the Tithes ſhou'd be apply'd to the Maintenance and Subſiſtence of the Army. That the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd that his late Declarations, and the Senate's Decree, which aimed at nothing but the eaſe of the People, ſhou'd be confirm'd by the Eſtates. That both the Regular and Secular Clergy ſhould forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with reſtore to the Crown, to the Nobility, and to all private Perſons, the Lands and Eſtates which they pretended had been bequeath'd to 'em ſince the Reign and Prohibition of King <hi>Canutſon.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1452"/> That they ſhou'd be oblig'd to contribute, as well as the Laity to the ſupport of the Army, proportionably to their ancient Eſtates and Acquiſitions: That the Biſhops ſhou'd not hereafter inherit the Eſtates of the inferiour Clergy, by which means the beſt Families of the Kingdom inſenſible decay'd and came to ruin. That thoſe Prelates ſhou'd renounce their pretended Right and Penalties and Forfeitures. That they ſhou'd forthwith put the King in poſſeſſion of their Forts, which had often ſerv'd for a ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Seditious and Rebellions Perſons. And Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they ſhou'd be for ever excluded from the Senate, or any ſhare in the Government.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had the Chancellor ended his Speech, but the Biſhop of <hi>Lincopinc</hi> ſtood up to oppoſe him, and ſpoke to this effect. That it was no wonder to hear of that bold Propoſal, to take away the Church-Lands from the Clergy, while the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> were countenanced in their endeavours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate the true Religion. He declared to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, that he and the whole Clergy were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to defend the Catholick Faith, never to part with any Church-Lands, or yield up any of their Rights or Priviledges, without an expreſs Order from the Pope, whom they own'd as the Supreme Diſpoſer of the Church Revenues, as he was the Infallible Judge in Matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:62547:137"/>
               <p>The King, amaz'd at the boldneſs of that Prelate,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1527"/> turn'd towards the Senators and the Nobility, as it were to ingage ſome of 'em to make a ſutable reply. Immediately <hi>Tureiohanſon</hi> ſtood up; who, far from ſiding with the King, told him with a great deal of conſidence, that the Biſhop of <hi>Lincopinc</hi> cou'd not be too much commended for his Zeal, and that he wiſh'd all the <hi>Swedes</hi> were inſpir'd with ſo noble a reſolution to defend the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith and the Liberty of the Nation: He was applauded by the Biſhops and the whole Clergy, and their Acclamations were ſeconded by many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of <hi>Weſt-Gothland,</hi> who bewail'd in ſecret the decaying State of the Ancient Religion, but durſt not freely ſpeak their mind for ſear of the King's diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tureiohanſon</hi>'s diſcourſe, and the Applauſe it met with among thoſe of his party, did both ſurpriſe the King, and ſtir up his Paſſion: He complain'd of their ingratitude and want of reſpect, and told them that the <hi>Swedes</hi> cou'd neither live without Kings, nor endure 'em after they were choſen; that he was ſenſible, his Declarations againſt the Clergy and the Senate's Decree concerning Tithes, had procur'd him more Enemies in the Kingdom, than he had among the Neighbouring Nations, who envi'd the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of <hi>Sweden;</hi> that he knew, there were many in that Aſſembly, who (according to the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Proverb) wiſhed the Head of an Ax ſtruck deep into his Head, tho' none were ſo bold as to take up the handle; and that they were groſsly miſtaken, if they thought he mounted the Throne, as an Actor comes upon a Stage, only to perſonate a King: He declar'd withal, that he expected obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and that in the preſent juncture of Aſſairs it was requiſite he ſhou'd uſe an abſolute Power, to reſiſt the Deſigns and Attempts both of the Emperor and King <hi>Chriſtiern.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:62547:138"/>
               <p>But if they thought he cou'd not juſtly require Obedience and Submiſſion, he proteſted that he was ready to reſign the Crown. That he only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a re-imburſment for the Charge he had been at for the defence of the State, ſince he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Government; that afterwards he wou'd let them peaceably injoy the Fruit of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſolemnly promiſe to leave the Kingdom, for ever. At theſe words Grief and Anger drew ſome Tears from his Eyes, and without expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an anſwer he ſuddenly left the Aſſembly, and went into the Caſtle, follow'd by the Principal Officers of his Army; who urg'd him, to aſſume an abſolute Power, and offer'd to execute his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders without the conſent of the Eſtates.</p>
               <p>The Chancellor ſtaid, to hinder the Eſtates from taking any Reſolutions contrary to the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, in his Abſence. But nothing was concluded that Day. The Temporal Senators and principal Lords, alarmed at the angry Retreat of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> roſe up immediately, as if they had been afraid to be ſeen in the Company of the King's Adverſaries. On the other Hand the Biſhops and the whole Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, moſt of the Lords of <hi>Weſt-Gothland,</hi> and all the Rabble of <hi>Weſteras</hi> conducted <hi>Tureiohanſon</hi> home as it were in Triumph.</p>
               <p>That haughty Lord was ſo puff'd up with their Applauſes, that he cou'd not conceal his Joy to ſee himſelf at the Head of a Party which he lookt upon as formidable to the King. He fancy'd that he ſhould Govern the Eſtates, and by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority influence all their reſolutions. He enter'd his Houſe with the ſound of Trumpets and Kettle Drums, elevated with his preſent ſucceſs, without conſidering, that the Favour of the People is uſually ſhort-liv'd, and that 'tis extreamly hard for a great Man to come off with Honour when the Prince's Authority ſeems to be ſlighted or diſregarded.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:62547:138"/>
               <p>The Eſtates met again the next Day, which was ſpent wholly in Conteſts on both ſides. <hi>Olaus Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri</hi> made a new Challenge to Dr. <hi>Gallus,</hi> but it came to nothing; becauſe <hi>Gallus</hi> wou'd argue in <hi>Latin,</hi> and in a Scholaſtic manner, and <hi>Olaus</hi> reſolv'd to diſpute in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Tongue. The Aſſembly was divided into two Parties; one that ſtood up for the Preſervation of the Rights and Privileges of the Church, as the greateſt Bulwark of the ancient Religion; and the other, conſidering <hi>Luther</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin as a problematical and indifferent Opinion, till the Church ſhou'd decide the Controverſy in a general Council, were for an intire ſubmiſſion to the King's Will.</p>
               <p>The Chancellor omitted nothing to make the chief Deputies ſenſible, that Kingdoms ought not to be Rul'd by the Maxims of Prieſts and Monks, who have a ſeparate Intereſt from that of the State, owning a Foreign Prince, the Pope, for their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign. That the ſafety of the State, upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and in all Emergencies, ought to be the prime and over-ruling Law; and all other humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions being made only for the Preſervation of Civil Society, the Prince and ſupream Magiſtrate ought to be veſted with a Power to alter 'em, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Exigencies and Temper of every Nation. That the greateſt part of the Eccleſiaſticks and Monks had ſeiz'd on the whole Wealth of the Kingdom, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der different Pretences of Devotion. That the Biſhops, by the Claim they aſſum'd of being the ſole Heirs of the Prieſts, ruin'd daily ſome of the beſt Families; and by that Title, as well as their pretended Right to Penalties and Conſiſcations, incroach'd inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly upon all the Eſtates; that they ſecur'd their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Acquiſitiones from all Attempts of Recovery, under the Name of Church Lands; terrifying with the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By ſuch Diſcourſes, and other ſecret Ways, the Chancellor brought over moſt of the Deputies to the King's Party; and gain'd many of the Clergy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to yield to his Arguments, under pretext that Religion was not the Thing aimed at, but meerly a Temporal Concern; beſides, that they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aw'd by the Power and the Anger of the King, and terrify'd with this Notion, That too obſtinate a Reſiſtance was next to down-right Treaſon and Rebellion.</p>
               <p>The King had already made ſure of the beſt part of the Aſſembly, when <hi>Tureiohanſon,</hi> flattering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the imaginary Strength of his Party, talkt of nothing but burning the Hereticks, and urg'd the Eſtates, with a great deal of Earneſtneſs, to make a Law to declare <hi>Lutherans</hi> incapable of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the Crown, with a ſecret Deſign to exclude the King, and that he might have a ſufficient Ground to oppoſe the Solemnity of his Coronation. This Point was debated with a great deal of heat in the Aſſembly, every one ſpeaking according to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or Inclination; when the Biſhop of <hi>Stregnez,</hi> who had been ſecretly gain'd by the Court, deſir'd leave to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as that Prelate had obtain'd liberty to be heard,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Loc. l.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 270.</note> he told the Eſtates, That he was ſurpriz'd to ſee Men in that Aſſembly who had the conſidence to ſpeak ſo publickly of the King's Abdication, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt within his hearing, or at leaſt under the Canon of his Caſtle. That Matters of ſuch vaſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance were not to be decided by Caballing, or Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Voices. That there were many in that Aſſembly who cou'd ſignalize their Courage againſt his as in a Field of Battel, and yet perhaps cou'd
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62547:139"/>hardly bear the very Looks and Preſence of their King, if he ſhou'd appear in Arms. He ask'd 'em what Forces they had to oppoſe a Prince who had the ſole Command of all the Troops? And, in caſe he were willing to Abdicate, whether they had a ſufficient Fund to repay him the vaſt Charge he had been at for the Defence of the State?</p>
               <p>He added, That 'twas not an eaſy matter to reckon with a great Captain at the Head of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Army, who might as long as he pleas'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Sovereign Power, for a Pledge of Payment. That they were groſly miſtaken if they thought that <hi>Sweden</hi> under another Prince, or another Form of Government, was able to make a long Reſiſtance againſt ſo many Enemies with which the Kingdom was ſurrounded. That all intelligent Perſons were ſenſible, that the Power and Strength of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom lay more in the King's Perſon than Dignity; that his Majeſty cou'd never make a ſtep to quit the Throne, but what wou'd make way for the Kings of <hi>Denmark, Chriſtiern</hi> or <hi>Frederick</hi> to aſcend it; and that 'twas only his Courage and Valor that kept all the Enemies of the Nation in awe.</p>
               <p>The ſame Prelate added, That tho' the King did not appear a Friend to the Clergy, yet the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power of Truth, and the cordial Affection he bore to the State oblig'd him to own, that the ſafety of the Kingdom depended entirely upon his Royal Perſon. That he acknowledg'd the <hi>Great Marſhal's</hi> Zeal was to be commended, by which he had laid eternal Obligations upon both the Regular and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Clergy; but that a violent and unlimited Zeal had often occaſion'd great Miſchiefs. That for his part he thought it more expedient for 'em to quit ſome Rights, and to give up ſome of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, at a time when their Compliance was ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the preſervation of the Kingdom, than by too great a Stiffneſs and Self-intereſſedneſs to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62547:140"/>exaſperate a Prince who was equally powerful and neceſſary.

That the King had often declar'd, he was reſolv'd to perſiſt in the Religion of his Anceſtors. That, after all, they cou'd not but own, that the Monks had, under the pretence of Devotion, introduc'd into the Church many Superſtitions, which utterly defac'd the Chriſtian Religion.

               <p>This Prelate's Diſcourſe made the greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the Eſtates, becauſe 'twas not expected from one of his Character. The Biſhops and the whole Clergy were full of Rage and Indignation, but he receiv'd a loud and general Applauſe from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the reſt of the Aſſembly. In ſhort, his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſeem'd at once to have diſpers'd all thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, which had made 'em ſo long oppoſe the King's Deſigns. They lookt upon his Abſence both as their Fault and Misfortune. Their Heat againſt their Prince was chang'd to an Emulation among 'em to give him what ſatisfaction he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that they might have the Happineſs to ſee him ſooner at the Head of the Aſſembly. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately they made a Declaration ſutable to his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, notwithſtanding the clamorous oppoſition of the Clergy; and notice was given to the <hi>Great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal</hi> that it was not ſafe for him to make ſo great a noiſe in the Aſſembly.

               <p>At laſt it was ſolemnly Enacted by the Eſtates, That the Biſhops ſhou'd immediately put their Forts into the Hands of the King's Officers, and disband their Troops and Garriſons. That thoſe Prelates ſhou'd not any more be admitted into the Senate, as being a hinderance to the diſcharge of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Functions. That it ſhou'd not be in their power to deprive the lawful Heirs of Eccleſiaſticks, of their Right of Inheritance; nor ſhou'd thereafter convert to their own Uſes the Penalties and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, which properly belong'd to the Crown.

That the Nobility and Gentry might recover their Eſtates mortgag'd to the Church, by paying off the Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage. That the two Thirds of the Tithes, injoy'd by moſt Biſhops and Abbots, ſhou'd be ſequeſter'd for the ſubſiſtence of the Troops, ſo long as there ſhou'd be any Ground to apprehend a War in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and that in time of Peace they ſhou'd be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the Erecting and Indowing of publick Schools and Hoſpitals in all the Provinces. That thoſe among the Clergy ſhou'd be ſeverely Puniſh'd, who ſhou'd offer to Excommunicate any one for a meerly Temporal Concern. That the Magiſtrates ſhou'd reſtrain the <hi>Mendicant</hi> Friars from their uſual Rambles, and the King ſhou'd diſpoſe, at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, of all the Priviledges of the Clergy. Laſtly, by the Chancellor's cunning Inſinuation, it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, That all conſiderable Churches ſhou'd be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62547:141"/>with learned and godly Men, that ſhou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to the People the pure Word of God; which in the Language of thoſe Times ſignify'd, that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theraniſm</hi> ſhou'd be preach'd with Authority.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was this Act put into form, but all the Deputies ſign'd it; and even the Biſhops, who were not well united among themſelves. Some of 'em were gain'd by the Court, and others out of fear were forc'd to ſubſcribe; tho' they plainly ſaw that they ſign'd the Abdication of their Dignities, and even an Article contrary to the Catholick Religion. The Eſtates pray'd the Chancellor and Dr. <hi>Olaus Petri</hi> to carry the Act to the King; and charg'd 'em to aſſure his Majeſty, that he ſhou'd never hereafter find any oppoſition to his Will in that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p>The King, having thus brought 'em to his own Terms, went to the Aſſembly, where, by the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's Mouth he thank'd the Deputies for their having at laſt taken Reſolutions ſutable to the preſent Exigencies. He aſſur'd 'em, That henceforward he wou'd have a particular regard for the People; and that he hop'd, by the help of that Supply alone which they had now granted him, <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhou'd have no cauſe to fear her Enemies. Then he diſmiſs'd the Eſtates, with Aſſurances of his Gratitude to ſuch among the Deputies as had expreſs'd moſt Zeal for his Intereſt.</p>
               <p>By this Act <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> finding himſelf Maſter in a manner both of the Wealth and Religion of the Church, went at the Head of a Body of Horſe to ſee the Act put in execution. He paſt ſucceſſively from Province to Province, attended by <hi>Olaus Petri</hi> and many other <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctors, whom he order'd to Preach before him in the principal Churches. At the ſame time he commanded the Titles of all Church-Lands to be brought before him; Re-uniting preſently to his Demeſn, and reſtoring to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62547:141"/>Proprietors or their Heirs, ſuch Lands as the Clergy had acquir'd ſince the Reign of King <hi>Canutſon.</hi> By which means he recover'd both from the Regular and Secular Clergy more than two Thirds of their Revenues, and by computation ſeiz'd upon Thirteen Thouſand conſiderable Farms, ſome of which he reunited to his own Demeſns, and with the reſt he recompens'd his Creatures and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officers of his Army. At the ſame time he made great Sums of Mony of the Church-Plate, which he caus'd to be melted down to enrich the publick Treaſury.</p>
               <p>The Progreſs of the King all over his Kingdom gave the Final Blow to the Catholick Religion. An open War was in a manner declar'd againſt the Clergy, and the Foundations of the old Religion were undermin'd by the Flight or Change of its Miniſters. There could be no want of pretences at a time when none were requir'd to turn Prieſts out of their Benefices for perſevering in the profeſſion of their Ancient Religion.</p>
               <p>Moſt Curates and other Benefic'd Clergy-Men ſcrupl'd not to own the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrin, to keep their Dwelling-Houſes and part of their Livings. Many of 'em were only requir'd to Marry, and to introduce into their Churches the Divine Service in the Vulgar Tongue, which was the ſureſt mark of a Prieſt's converſion to <hi>Lutheraniſm.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Lincopinc</hi> retir'd to <hi>Poland,</hi> and the reſt of the Prelates lay ſculking in their Houſes without dare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perform the Functions of their Miniſtry, for fear of expoſing themſelves to new Perſecutions. They waited with a ſervile patience for the King's Orders to diſpoſe of their Perſons and Dignities, always ready to yield him obedience; but much more vex'd at the Alteration he made in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, than for the change of Religion. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Scara,</hi> who was not well acquainted with the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62547:142"/>controverſies that were agitated among the Divines on both ſides, was the only Biſhop who reſolv'd to defend by the ſtrength of Arms his Dignity and the Revenues of his Church. In purſuance of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he engag'd <hi>Tureiohanſon</hi> with ſeveral Lords of <hi>Weſt-Gothland,</hi> who endeavour'd to raiſe an Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in that Province; but the Country-People were ſo prepoſſeſs'd with Eſteem and Reſpect for the King, that they refus'd to riſe up in Arms; and the Biſhop ſaw himſelf abandon'd by the whole Chapter which began to ſavour <hi>Luther</hi>'s Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of the Monks quitted their Monaſtries, ſome out of a deſire of Liberty, and others for want of a ſettl'd ſubſiſtence. Thoſe who remain'd ſtedfaſt in their Religion fied to the <hi>Dale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carlians,</hi> who had openly declar'd againſt <hi>Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</hi> There theſe miſerable Fugitives thought to have their Wants reliev'd and their Grievances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd. <hi>Dalecarlia,</hi> as I ſaid before, is a remote Province in the Northern parts of <hi>Sweden,</hi> inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a rude and ignorant People, fond of their Ancient Religion, almoſt meer Savages, inur'd to hardſhip, and in that reſpect fit for War, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Diſcipline. The whole Province ſwarm'd with Eccleſiaſticks, both of the Secular and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Clergy, old Men and Women loaded with young Children; who having quitted their Houſholds, choſe rather to wander in the Mountains, than embrace <hi>Lutheraniſm.</hi> The <hi>Dalecarlians,</hi> mov'd with their complaints, and incens'd at the ſight of the new Paſtors in their Churches, or of the old ones who alter'd the uſual Ceremonies, took up Arms with a great deal of fury: The Prieſts and Monks joyn'd with 'em, and all the Catholicks and Malecontents eſpous'd their Quarrel; ſome out of zeal for their Ancient Religion, and others out of ſpite becauſe they had no ſhare in the Spoils of the Church.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:62547:142"/>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Scara</hi> no ſooner heard of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, but he fled privately to that Province, to joyn with the Rebels. He was accompany'd by the Great Marſhal, and many Gentlemen of <hi>Weſt-Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> who had ingag'd not to lay down their Arms, till they had obtain'd the Reſtoration of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Religion. They were receiv'd with great Acclamations by the <hi>Dalecarlians,</hi> who gave the general Command of their Forces to <hi>Tureiohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Lord had three Sons, the two Eldeſt of whom were near the King's Perſon, and the Third was Grand Provoſt of the Cathedral of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> who hearing that his Father was at the head of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, made it his buſineſs to ſcatter Manifeſtos againſt the King thro' the whole Province of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pland;</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the People to take up Arms and revenge the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries that were done to the Altars; and to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the People by his example, he put himſelf at the head of ſome Troops. In the mean time the great Marſhal, his Father ſent order to his two other Sons, to ſteal away from the Court, and joyn their Brother, or come to him with as many of their Friends as they cou'd perſwade to follow 'em. But theſe young Lords, were highly diſpleas'd with their Father's Rebellion, which oblig'd 'em either to declare againſt him, or againſt their Sovereign, and of two Duties which appear'd to 'em equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indiſpenſable, to chuſe the one, and renounce the other.</p>
               <p>But their Allegiance to the King prevail'd at laſt over their Duty to their Father, and even to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it ſelf. They concluded, that in a State-Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair they ought to adhere to the Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that the difference of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was not a ſufficient ground to excuſe 'em from the obedience they ow'd to their Lawful Prince. They conſider'd beſides, that their Loyalty to the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62547:143"/>King might probably obtain their Father's Pardon; and that it was more agreeable to the rules of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to put themſelves in a condition by their Fidelity to obtain Pardon for their Father, than to make themſelves guilty of the ſame Crime, in expectation of a better Fortune. Upon theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations they deliver'd their Letters to the King, proteſting that they were ready to lay down their Lives for his ſervice. <hi>Guſtavus</hi> receiv'd 'em very graciouſly, and promis'd to prefer 'em: But ſeem'd neither to be ſurpriz'd nor alarm'd at the News. Nor did he make any apparent preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in order to reduce the Rebels; ſaying that he wou'd decline appearing in Arms, that his Subjects might not be oblig'd to fight againſt each other, and that he hop'd to cruſh the Rebellion by gentler Methods.</p>
               <p>Yet he loſt no time, but made his Troops ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly file off by different ways, towards the Borders of <hi>Dalecarlia,</hi> that he might be all of a ſudden in a condition to reduce the Rebels by the fear of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Upon the firſt News of the Inſurrection he had ſent ſome Perſons from Court, who had Friends among the Malecontents, and were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known among the <hi>Dalecarlians,</hi> with inſtructions to reduce the Rebels by fair means. Theſe Agents ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd themſelves firſt to the Biſhop of <hi>Scara,</hi> the great Marſhal, and other Malecontents that had joyn'd the <hi>Dalecarlians.</hi> They indeavour'd to gain the leading Men by advantageous Offers, but they found 'em moſt obſtinate; and thoſe who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to treat, had ſo little an influence upon the party, and ſtood upon ſo high Terms, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents did not think fit to buy 'em off at ſo great a rate. They had better ſucceſs among the <hi>Dalecar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Peaſants, whom they prevail'd upon to ſend Deputies to the Court; perſwading 'em, that his Majeſty wou'd deny nothing to a People to whom
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62547:143"/>he ow'd his Crown and Glory; but their true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was only to amuſe 'em, that they might be leſs cautious in providing for their own defence.</p>
               <p>The Deputies of the <hi>Dalecarlians,</hi> not penetrating into the King's Policy, but concluding by the ſteps he made, that he ſtood in Awe of 'em, thought they might eaſily make their own Terms. In the Name of their Province, and of all the Roman Catholicks of the Kingdom, they demanded that <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> ſhou'd be puniſh'd in <hi>Sweden</hi> as a Capital Crime; that the Marriage of Prieſts and Monks ſhou'd be Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd; the Bells and Church-Plate reſtor'd; and all Perſons Burnt without any Regard or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, that ſhou'd be convicted to have eaten Fleſh on Fiſh-Days. That the King ſhou'd oblige himſelf, after the example of his Predeceſſors, never to paſs the River of <hi>Brunebeck,</hi> which ſeparates their Province from <hi>Weſtmania,</hi> without giving 'em Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages for the ſecurity of their Priviledges. But, above all, that both King and Courtiers ſhou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume the ancient Habit of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to ſtrangers for new Faſhions and Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> gave the Deputies great hopes that he wou'd grant at leaſt part of their Demands; while he ſecretly put all things in a readineſs to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the Rebels, with his whole Army. Having receiv'd advice, that his Troops were come within a days March of their appointed Rendezvous, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſmiſs'd the Deputies, and order'd them to tell their Country-men that he wou'd never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to treat with his Subjects, and that they might appear in Arms in the Plain of <hi>Tuna,</hi> to fight the Battel he was reſolv'd to offer them at the head of his Army. He added, that if they wou'd avoid the effects of his indignation, they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Malecontents out of their Province, lay down their Arms, and ſubmit to his Mercy.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:62547:144"/>
               <p>Aſſoon as the King had diſmiſt the Deputies,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1525"/> he took Poſt immediately for the Army; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, were ſo amaz'd at his unexpected Diligence and Reſolution, that they were ſeiz'd with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fear and Conſternation when they heard of his Approach. <hi>Tureiohanſon</hi> and thoſe of his party ſuſpected the <hi>Dalecarlians,</hi> and fancy'd they had made a ſeparate Peace for themſelves; and the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants reciprocally thought they were betray'd by the Lords. In ſhort, they were jealous of each other, and their mutual ſuſpicion and diſtruſt was by degrees chang'd to Hatred and Enmity.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Scara</hi> and <hi>Tureiohanſon</hi> not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves ſafe with the <hi>Dalecarlians</hi> made their eſcape privately into <hi>Norway;</hi> from whence they retir'd to King <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> in the Low-Countries; and the reſt of the Malecontents, alarm'd at their flight, ſome fled one way, ſome another. The <hi>Dalecar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> ſeeing themſelves without a Head or Leader, reſolv'd to ſubmit, and yield to their Prince's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. They went to the Plain of <hi>Tuna,</hi> where the King ſtaid for 'em at the Head of his Army. He commanded his Horſe to ſurround 'em, and the Rebels at the ſame time to diſcover their Ring lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The affrighted Peaſants declar'd their names and the King immediately caus'd 'em to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, to curb by ſo neceſſary a ſeverity the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and inconſtant Humor of theſe People. Thus by an innocent Artifice and commendable Diligence, he appeas'd a furious Infurrection, without any Effuſion of Blood, or Diminution of his Forces.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the laſt Efforts of an Unbridl'd and Tumultuous Liberty, which was forc'd to give way to a more abſolute, and conſequently more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Dominion. After this the whole Kingdom ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the King, and all his Subjects imbrac'd <hi>Lutheraniſm;</hi> ſome out of regard to their private Intereſt, and to make their Court, and others out
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62547:144"/>of their abhorrence of the irregular Life of the Clergy.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1527"/> The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctors gain'd ſome Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes by perſwading 'em that their Maſters Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Matters of Religion, which were falſly reckon'd Innovations, were nothing elſe but primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity reſtor'd and purg'd from all Monkiſh Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions; and many were glad to be convinc'd of the Truth of the prevailing Religion, that they might preſerve their Eſtates without being forc'd to ſeek their Fortunes abroad.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62547:145"/>were Buri'd with the ſame Prayers that are us'd to beg God to relieve the Souls of the Faithful, tho' the Doctrin of Purgatory was condemn'd by the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans.</hi>

They own'd the <hi>Augsburg</hi>-Confeſſion as the Rule and Standard of their Faith, and ſolemnly renounc'd their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Pope, as Head of the Church. They order'd the Roman Worſhip to be intirely aboliſh'd, prohibited all Prayers for the Dead, borrow'd from the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches of <hi>Germany</hi> the manner of adminiſtring Baptiſm and the Communion, declar'd the Marriage of Prieſts Lawful, and Condemn'd Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy and Monaſtick Vows.

               <p>Yet they met with great difficulties in aboliſhing the Practice of the Roman Church in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments. The People, and the Women eſpecially, cou'd not be ſatisfy'd without the Ceremonies of Baptiſm, and the Prayers for the Dead.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62547:145"/>Women, thro' an exceſſive Fear, proceeding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as much from their Temper as Virtue, thought their Children cou'd not be well baptiz'd without the uſe of Salt and Exorciſms. And a ſmall reſidue of Faith as to the belief of Purgatory created ſuch a diſturbance in their Minds, on the account of their deceas'd Relations, as cou'd not be allay'd by all the Eloquence of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctors.</p>

                  <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> fearing the Complaints and Diſcontent of the People ſhou'd break out into a new Rebellion, order'd the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Miniſters to comply with thoſe who ſtood up obſtinately for the ancient Ceremonies, and not to uſe the new, but where they found a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per diſpos'd to receive 'em.</p>
               <p>The King having thus compleated the alteration of Religion,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1530"/> undertook another Project which gave him no leſs hope of filling his Coffers. Moſt of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Provinces were formerly over-ſpread with vaſt Foreſts. King <hi>Olaus Traetelga, Amund,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 891.</note> and ſome of their Succeſſors, caus'd a great part of 'em to be Diſ-foreſted, and beſtow'd theſe new Lands in Fee-farm upon the Nobility and Gentry, for which they were to pay a certain Duty to the Crown. The Lords and Gentlemen had, by degrees, during the Civil Wars, exempted themſelves from paying thoſe ancient Duties, and a long Preſcription ſeem'd to have aboliſh'd 'em, till they were reviv'd by the King, who requir'd both from the Nobility and Gentry, either to part with their <hi>Fiefs</hi> or to pay Rents at which they were originally tax'd. The Claims and Demands of this Prince differ'd not much from the moſt arbitrary Laws and Decrees; and the Parties concern'd, alarm'd at this after-clap, offer'd to come to a fair Compoſition. The chief Lords of each Province came and treated about it with the Chancellor, and agreed to pay to the King Ten Marks of Silver for every Fief or Mannor, or (as it was then call'd) for every Land that paid Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Crown.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:62547:146"/>
               <p>Thus every thing ſucceeded with this Prince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deſire, and even beyond his hope. He look'd upon the alteration of Religion as the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt and moſt important paſſage of his Reign; and the humbling of the Clergy, who were no leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to him than the <hi>Danes,</hi> as a ſecond Conqueſt of <hi>Sweden.</hi> Of all his Enemies he had none left but <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> that cou'd make him uneaſy, or occaſion the leaſt diſturbance. That Prince was ſtill in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> from whence he earneſtly ſolicited the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, his Brother-in-law, that he wou'd contribute his aſſiſtance in order to his Reſtoration. <hi>Guſtavus</hi> kept Spies about him, who gave him Intelligence, that <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> was levying Soldiers in <hi>Holland.</hi> From thence he concluded, that the Threats and Deſign of a Deſcent in the Northern Kingdoms were ready to break out into Action, and that <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> were like to be the Scene of the War. He immediately ſent notice of it to <hi>Frederick</hi> K. of <hi>Denmark;</hi> and at the ſame time thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to fortify himſelf againſt the Deſigns of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> by ſome conſiderable Alliance. He conceiv'd, that the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who were extremely jealous of the Emperor's Power, wou'd be eaſily perſwaded to ſupport his Intereſt, by reaſon of their Conformity in point of Religion. Upon theſe Conſiderations he demanded in Marriage the eldeſt Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Saxe Lawenburg.</hi> The Duke, charm'd with the valor and fame of <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtavus,</hi> heard the Propoſal with great ſatisfaction, and ſent the Princeſs, his Daughter, with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Attendance to <hi>Lubeck,</hi> whither <hi>Guſtavus</hi> ſent his whole Fleet to receive her. After her arrival at <hi>Stockholm,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1531"/> the Marriage was conſummated with all the Joy and Magnificence that are uſual on ſuch Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.
<note place="margin">Sept. 24.</note> At the ſame time the King ſent the late <hi>Adminiſtrator's</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Saxe,</hi> his Father-in-law, under pretext of improving his Knowledge,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62547:146"/>by making him Travel; but in effect that he might remove, from the ſight of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> a young Prince that ſeem'd to have a better Title to the Crown, whoſe Preſence ſtirr'd up the Compaſſion of the moſt Moderate, and might ſerve for a Pretence to all diſſaffected Perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Nuptial Ceremonies were ſcarce at an end, when he receiv'd Intelligence, that a great number of Troops rais'd for the late King <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> were privately Imbarking at one of the Ports of <hi>Holland.</hi> Upon which he diſpatch'd a new Courier to the K. of <hi>Denmark</hi> (according to a former Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) and at the ſame time put himſelf at the Head of his Army, both to obſerve the Enemy, and to hinder the Catholicks and Malecontents from favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deſcent of that Prince.</p>
               <p>The Emperor had all along flatter'd him with hopes, that he wou'd undertake the Expedition him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with all the Forces of the Empire. But the almoſt continual War in which he was engag'd with <hi>France,</hi> broke that Deſign; ſo that <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by ſo many Diſappointments and weary of perſonating ſo long, in a Foreign Country, a King without a Crown, reſolv'd, with ſome Troops he had gather'd from ſeveral Parts, to try his Fortune, and endeavour to force a Paſſage into his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tureiohanſon,</hi> who was always as brave as a Hero at plotting and contriving Work for others, us'd all poſſible Arguments to perſwade that Prince to make an Attempt upon <hi>Sweden.</hi> To flatter him, and at the ſame time to engage him in a Deſign that cou'd not be proſecuted without his Aſſiſtance, he aſſur'd him, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> were ſo incens'd at the late Change of Religion, that they long'd for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration. That 'twou'd be ſufficient to land 3000 Horſe in that Kingdom, and that the firſt Maſs that was ſaid in his Camp wou'd draw thither all the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62547:147"/>Malecontents, and even many of <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s own Soldiers. That notwithſtanding the fam'd Politicks and Subtilty of that Prince, he had ſign'd his own <hi>Abdication</hi> in the Aſſembly of the Clergy at <hi>Orebro,</hi> by aboliſhing the Catholick Religion. That, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a ſmall number of Courtiers, and ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Officers who had a ſhare in the ſpoils of the Clergy, the whole Nation deteſted his Tyranny and the Change of Religion. That he had disbanded his Foreign Horſe, and that his Foot conſiſted only of an undiſciplin'd Militia, the greateſt part of whom wou'd certainly deſert <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> as ſoon as King <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> ſhou'd declare, that his only Deſign was to reſtore the true Religion, and to redreſs the Grievances of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe plauſible Aſſurances, <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to try the chance of War, with about Ten thouſand Men of different Nations, whom he had liſted in his Service during his abode in the <hi>Low Countries.</hi> With this Body of Men, imbark'd in Thirty Ships, he ſet out of a Port in <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſteer'd his Courſe for <hi>Norway,</hi> which at that time was almoſt deſtitute of Troops and Garriſons, which ſeem'd to be a needleſs Precaution in a Country that was ſufficiently defended by the Barrenneſs of its Soil, and the Rocks and Mountains with which 'tis overſpread. <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> knew, that he was leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected there, than in <hi>Denmark</hi> or <hi>Sweden,</hi> and from thence he deſign'd to enter <hi>Sweden,</hi> either by <hi>Weſt-Gothland</hi> or <hi>Dalecarlia;</hi> imagining, that the Country People of theſe Provinces, were ſtill ſo incens'd at the Execution of their Country-men, that they wou'd immediately riſe up again in Arms, and favor his Attempt.</p>
               <p>This unfortunate Prince met in his voyage with a terrible Storm,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1532"/> which diſpers'd all his Fleet, and ſunk ſome of his Ships. He narrowly eſcap'd Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack upon the Coaſt of <hi>Norway,</hi> and with much a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62547:147"/>do got to the Bay of <hi>Bahus,</hi> with the ſhatter'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of his Fleet; where he landed without the leaſt oppoſition, and reſolv'd to march to <hi>Weſt-Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as a more commodious place for the ſubſiſtence of his Troops: But, upon Information that there was a conſiderable Body of Horſe upon the Borders, to oppoſe his Paſſage, he was oblig'd to march North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, towards <hi>Dalecarlia.</hi> In his way he beſieg'd a Town call'd <hi>Obſlo,</hi> which yielded on the firſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, not being in a condition to make any Reſiſtance. After that he ſtorm'd the Caſtle of <hi>Carloſtadt,</hi> and ſome days after made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Congel.</hi> Theſe ſmall Succeſſes drew into his Army a great number of Country People of <hi>Norway,</hi> encourag'd with the hopes of plund'ring the <hi>Sweediſh</hi> Frontiers; and Archbiſhop <hi>Trolle</hi> joyn'd him with ſome Troops he had rais'd in <hi>Brandenburg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> had perhaps as little Reſpect for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Guſtavus;</hi> but 'twas his Intereſt to appear a zealous Aſſertor of that Religion ſince his Enemy was a profeſt <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and ſince the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his Deſigns depended entirely on the Aſſiſtance of the Clergy and Catholicks. He publiſh'd a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pardon, by way of a Manifeſto; in which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, That his principal Deſign was the Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the old Religion. This Declaration was induſtriouſly diſpers'd by the Archbiſhop's Emiſſaries; who made it their Buſineſs to perſwade People ev'ry where, That <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> had learn'd Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Moderation in the School of Adverſity; That he was become a mild, affable and moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince; but eſpecially, that in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ſo near the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> he had contracted an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Affection and Zeal for the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>This Manifeſto, and theſe private Inſinuations drew into his Party many <hi>Swedes,</hi> who ſtill adher'd to that Religion: And among others ſome <hi>Dalecar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:62547:148"/>who invited him to march into their Province. Theſe Peaſants cou'd not brook the Change of Church Ceremonies, but, above all things, cou'd not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear the Praiſes of God ſung in their Mother-Tongue. They offer'd to take up Arms, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for him, as ſoon as he ſhould enter into their Province; provided that he wou'd oblige himſelf, after his Reſtoration, to cauſe all the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to be burnt.</p>
               <p>But his March into that Province was ſtopt by the Snow, that cover'd all the Mountains which ſeparate <hi>Dalecarlia</hi> from the Kingdom of <hi>Norway.</hi> However, that he might find ſome Occupation for his Army, he advanc'd towards <hi>Akerhuys,</hi> and laid Siege before it, notwithſtanding the ſharpneſs of the Winter. <hi>Magnus Gyllenſtiern,</hi> a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Lord, and Viceroy of <hi>Norway,</hi> got into the Place, and reſiſted all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threats with which <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> endeavour'd to corrupt his Fidelity. He diſpatch'd ſeveral Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers to King <hi>Frederick,</hi> his Maſter, to acquaint him with the Enemy's Deſcent; aſſuring him, That <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> was very much ſtraitned for want of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and that <hi>Akerhuys</hi> was ſo well defended by the Snow and cold Weather, that he cou'd hold out above Four Months, in expectation of Relief from <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No ſooner was the Sea open, but <hi>Frederick</hi> order'd his Fleet to put to Sea, with a conſiderable Body of Land-Forces, under the Command of <hi>Canut Gyllen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiern,</hi> Biſhop elect of <hi>Odenſee</hi> in <hi>Funen,</hi> and <hi>Erie Gyllenſtiern,</hi> the Viceroy of <hi>Norway</hi>'s Brothers; Concluding, That they wou'd uſe all poſſible Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to ſave their Brother from falling into the Hands of a Prince, who, without regarding the Faith of Treaties, ſeldom gave his Enemies Quarter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavns</hi> on the other ſide, ſent ſeveral Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Forces, to cover the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Frontiers, with Orders to his Officers to obſerve <hi>Chriſtiern</hi>'s
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62547:148"/>Motions, and to act joyntly with <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. He ſent alſo a conſiderable number of Troops into <hi>Dalecarlia,</hi> to prevent an Inſurrection of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious People, and put himſelf at the head of the main Body of his Army, to keep the Catholicks and Malecontents from aſſiſting the Rebels. The two <hi>Daniſh</hi> Generals ſet ſail for <hi>Norway,</hi> with a Deſign to attack <hi>Chriſtiern</hi>'s Fleet; which they ſound in the Bay of <hi>Bahuys,</hi> and burnt entirely, after a Fight that laſted a whole day. After ſo important a Victory they landed their Forces, and march'd immediately to relieve the Viceroy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> upon the News of the entire Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Fleet, and the Deſcent of the <hi>Danes,</hi> rais'd the Siege of <hi>Akerhuys.</hi> He attempted once more to enter <hi>Sweden</hi> by the way of <hi>West-Gothland,</hi> but met in his Way 3000 <hi>Swediſh</hi> Horſe, who ſtopt his Paſſage. The <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Swedes</hi> advancing to attack him, he threw himſelf into the little Town of <hi>Congel,</hi> where he entrench'd himſelf, not ſo much in hope of eſcaping from his Enemies, as to avoid the fatal Blow for ſome Days. There he found himſelf inveſted on all Sides, ſurrounded with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Mountains, that were ſtill cover'd with Snow; in great want of Proviſions, and ſtraiten'd with Hunger more than by his Enemies. He was natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject to furious and violent Paſſions, which were ſowr'd and heighten'd by his Diſaſters: He grew ſo jealous and diffident that he ſuſpected <hi>Tureiohanſon</hi> of entertaining a private Correſpondence with King <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> becauſe he had told him in <hi>Flanders,</hi> That there were few Horſe in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army; he look'd upon that unfor tunate Lord with an Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſeem'd to denounce his approaching Fate; and ask'd him, Whether the Troops that appear'd upon the Frontiers of <hi>Gothland</hi> were Squadrons of <hi>Swediſh</hi> Women? The Great Marſhal wou'd have reply'd in his own Vindication, but he was order'd
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62547:149"/>to withdraw, and the next day he was found in the Streets of <hi>Congel,</hi> wallowing in his Blood, having, in all probability, been murder'd the Night before, by ſecret Orders from <hi>Chriſtiern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, that miſerable Prince perceiv'd that his Ruine grew daily more inevitable; the Famine increas'd in the Town, all the Avenues were poſſeſs'd by the Enemies, and their Trenches were ſo ſtrong that 'twas impoſſible to force 'em to fight. In theſe unhappy Circumſtances, the ſtarv'd and deſpairing <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> had not ſo much as the ſad Comfort of hoping to die with his Sword in his hand. Moſt of his Troops periſh'd for hunger or deſerted before his Eyes; his Orders were ſlighted, and there was not the leaſt ſhadow of Diſcipline in his Army. Death, which ſeem'd unavoidable, made 'em forſake a Prince, who was neither lov'd nor fear'd. Many of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers fled into the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Camp, and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy to exchange their Liberty for Bread.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Odenſee,</hi> mov'd with Compaſſion for a Prince, that had been his Sovereign, offer'd him an Interview, to which <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> conſented, and both repair'd immediately to the Place appointed for their meeting.

                  <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> was ſo ſenſible of the hopeleſſneſs of his preſent Condition, and ſo earneſtly importun'd by his Soldiers to accept of ſuch Advantageous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, that he conſented to treat with that Prelate and his two Brothers, who commanded the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Forces. He obtain'd a Safe-Conduct and Proviſions for Archbiſhop <hi>Trolle</hi> and all his Party, and put himſelf into the Biſhop's Hands: Who, after ſome ſhort ſtay in <hi>Norway,</hi> to ſettle Affairs in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, departed thence with <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> to whom he gave repeated Aſſurances as to the Safety of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

               </p>
               <p>To compleat his Happineſs, there was nothing wanting but the fixing of the Succeſſion upon his Royal Iſſue.

               <p>This Reſignation was ſolemnly entred as a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Law, call'd the <hi>Hereditary <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62547:151"/>abrogated. <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> quarter'd the <hi>Three Crowns</hi> in his Coat Armorial, which are the Royal Arms of <hi>Sweden,</hi> as a publick Claim and Mark of his Right to that Kingdom, under pretext that Queen <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Waldemar</hi> Reign'd over the three Kingdoms of the North; tho' 'twas proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a like reaſon that made the Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> take theſe <hi>Three Crowns</hi> for their Arms, ſince they are found in the Shields and Seals of the Kings <hi>Steric</hi> and <hi>Birger</hi> II. about the middle of the Twelfth Age.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Guſtavus</hi> ſent an Embaſſy to <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> to complain of his Attempt; but cou'd obtain no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from a Young and Ambitious Prince, who was puff'd up with ſome Advantages he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten over the <hi>Hanſe-Towns,</hi> and obſtinately reſolv'd to purſue his Ancient Claim. <hi>Guſtavus</hi> finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf weakn'd and ſpent with Age, and the Fatigues of War, conceal'd his Reſentment; and did not think it convenient to ingage in a new War, or to hazard his Fortune and that of his Children, at a time when he maintain'd his Authority rather by his Reputation, than by his Valour. He was ſo far from dreading the oppoſition of a pretended Claim againſt the actual Poſſeſſion of a Crown which had lately been Intail'd upon his Iſſue by a Solemn Act, that he contented himſelf with procuring a Treaty to be ſet on foot at <hi>Bromſebroo,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1546"/> by which 'twas mutually agreed to leave the difference unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided for the ſpace of Fifty Years.</p>

                  <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> having thus ſettl'd a ſolid and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Peace in his Dominions, apply'd himſelf wholly to the Improvement of Trade; in order to which he receiv'd into his Ports all Merchant Ships from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> that his Subjects might be free'd from their dependence on the <hi>Lubeckers,</hi> who were poſſeſt of the whole Trade of <hi>Sweden.</hi> He erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Citadels on the Frontiers of his Kingdom, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62547:151"/>built Royal Palaces in ſeveral Places with a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence that till then was unknown to the <hi>Swedes.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1545"/> He never ſtay'd long in one place, but travell'd ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively from Province to Province, always atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a numerous Train of Courtiers, who ſtir'd up the Curioſity and Admiration of his People, and accuſtom'd 'em by their Example to reſpect his Authority. He ſign'd all Orders and Diſpatches with his own Hand, took Cognizance of all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, gave Audience to all Men, and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred Juſtice with great ſtrictneſs and ſeverity. All Controverſies and Suits about Religion, Revenues and Buildings; and even Differences and Law-Suits betwixt Noble Men were pleaded before him, and decided by him. As he had manag'd his Wars without Generals, ſo he rul'd in Peace without Miniſters. He reign'd alone without either Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites or Miſtreſſes; and the only object of all his Paſſions and Deſigns was his own Glory and the Happineſs of his Subjects. Some time before his Death he began to apply his mind to the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a ſuitable Match for his Eldeſt Son Prince <hi>Eric,</hi> that his Family might be ſupported by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Alliance. In purſuance of this deſign he caſt his Eyes upon <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> who was then Courted with great Aſſiduity by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi> But that Politick Queen had the dexterity to manage her Lovers as ſhe pleas'd and to feed 'em all with hopes, according to her own Inclination and the poſture of her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; by which it appear'd, that ſhe had taken a ſecret Reſolution never to Marry any of 'em.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> ſent an Embaſſy to her, to propoſe a ſtrict Alliance betwixt both Nations; and the chief Embaſſador was charg'd to feel her Pulſe, as to this Match. <hi>Denis Beure,</hi> the Prince's Governour, had that particular Commiſſion from the King. He was a <hi>Frenchman</hi> born, but a zealous <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist;</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:62547:152"/>who imagin'd that if he cou'd negotiate that Match for his Pupil,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1546"/> he might one Day eſtabliſh <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſm</hi> in <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> receiv'd, with all the external Marks of kindneſs and reſpect, the Propoſals he made to her in the Name of his Maſter, relating to Trade, and the Alliance or League betwixt the two Nations; and gave him a favourable Anſwer with reſpect to Prince <hi>Eric,</hi> but only in general Terms. The Embaſſador, fancying that all her obliging Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions concerning that Prince were real Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, made haſte home to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> as if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated his Negotiation. At his return he aſſur'd the King, that nothing but the Prince's Preſence was wanting to bring it to perfection, and that he was conſident his good Mien and perſonal Merit wou'd fix the Queen's Affections. Prince <hi>Eric,</hi> flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd with ſo tempting a Proſpect, was very earneſt with the King his Father, and preſs'd him hard to conſent that he might take a Journey to <hi>England.</hi> But <hi>Cuſtavus,</hi> jealous of the Glory of his Family, wou'd not expoſe the preſumptive Heir of the Crown to a Refuſal, nor give his conſent that he ſhou'd go out of the Kingdom, before ſome Articles were ſign'd.</p>
               <p>'Tis poſſible a more important, but more ſecret Reaſon, induc'd the King to reject that Voyage. <hi>Eric</hi> was a Prince indow'd with many excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Qualities. He had a majeſtick Preſence, an Air of Authority which drew Reſpect from all Men, a fiery Briskneſs in his Behavior, and a certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor that was uſually taken for Courage or Valor. But the luſtre of all theſe external Advantages was obſcur'd by ſome inward Defects that were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the King his Father, which he was willing to hide from the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> This Prince inherited a ſort of Extravagancy or Diſtraction from the Queen
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62547:152"/>his Mother, which now and then ſeiz'd upon his Brain, and prompted him to outragious Acts: There was a certain peeviſh Sulleneſs that appear'd in his Behaviour and Actions, which by an odd kind of Contagion ſeem'd to infect all thoſe who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd him. And in his moſt lucid Intervals he diſcover'd ſo much hardneſs and wildneſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that People were afraid of his Government, even before he was own'd and declar'd to be the next Succeſſor to the King his Father.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations made ſuch an impreſſion upon <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> that he was ſometimes reſolv'd to leave the Crown to his ſecond Son, a generous and good-natur'd Prince, who, by his Careſſes and obliging Behavior, had won the Hearts of all thoſe who were to be his Brother's Subjects. But the King, fearing leſt this Preference wou'd ſtir up a Civil War both in his Family and Kingdom, reſolv'd at laſt to regulate the Succeſſion according to the order of Birth-right. In the mean time to ſatisfy Prince <hi>Eric,</hi> whom his Tutor had inſpir'd with a violent Paſſion for Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he conſented at laſt, that Prince <hi>John,</hi> his ſecond Son, ſhou'd go to the Court of <hi>England</hi> under pretence of Travelling, and indeavour to draw at leaſt a verbal Promiſe from the Queen.</p>
               <p>This young Prince, being arriv'd at <hi>London,</hi> was receiv'd by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with great Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Joy. He had a ſhare in all her Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſhe frequently invited him to Hunting. In ſhort, that wiſe Princeſs, who made thoſe ſeveral Propoſals of Marriage ſubſervient to her Intereſt and politick Ends, omitted nothing that might amuſe the young Prince, by inſinuating that both his Preſence and Propoſals were agreeable to her. But ſhe declin'd ingaging further in that Affair, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that ſhe cou'd not in the preſent Juncture
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62547:153"/>conclude that Marriage ſo ſoon as ſhe cou'd have wiſh'd.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1544"/> This was the uſual Pretext with which ſhe amus'd all the Princes that courted her, whom ſhe was willing to admit as Lovers, but cou'd not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to accept 'em for Husbands.</p>
               <p>Upon the return of this Prince into <hi>Sweden,</hi> the King preſently concluded that his eldeſt Son Prince <hi>Eric</hi> wou'd have no better ſucceſs in the Purſuit of this Match,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Philip</hi> II.</note> than the K. of <hi>Spain,</hi> the D. of <hi>Alenſon,</hi> the Arch-duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> E. of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> my Lord <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and ſo many others, whom this Princeſs had flatter'd with the ſame Hopes, one after another, and often at the ſame time. But Prince <hi>Eric</hi> was ſo deluded by his Tutor's Suggeſtions, that he imagin'd his Preſence wou'd ſurmount all Obſtacles; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that his Brother had thwarted his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, either out of Jealouſy or Self-intereſt. He ſolicited the Senators and the King's Miniſters, both by Intreaties and Threats, to procure the King's Conſent for him to go to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court. <hi>Guſtavus</hi> conſidering his fierce and unruly Temper, and fearing that he wou'd either go without his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or raiſe ſome Diſturbance in the State, was at laſt perſuaded to grant his Deſire, and nam'd the Perſons that were to attend him.</p>
               <p>Then he made his <hi>last Will,</hi> and divided his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions among the Princes his Children: He left his Crown to Prince <hi>Eric,</hi> the Dukedom of <hi>Finland</hi> to Prince <hi>John, East-Gothland</hi> to <hi>Magnus,</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermania</hi> to <hi>Charles.</hi> The younger Princes being to injoy their Provinces by the Title of Principalities, but on condition of paying Homage and Fealty to the Crown of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Eric</hi> was ſo highly diſpleas'd at this Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, that he was ready to take up Arms to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Revocation of the <hi>Will;</hi> but the fear of his Father, who was King of his <hi>Children</hi> as well as of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62547:153"/>his <hi>Subjects,</hi> kept him in awe. He conceal'd his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, with a Reſolution to do himſelf Juſtice when the ſupreme Power ſhou'd fall into his Hands; and was juſt ready to ſet Sail for <hi>England,</hi> when he was detain'd at the Port of <hi>Elsburg,</hi> by the News he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of his Father's Deceaſe.</p>
               <p>That great Prince was ſeiz'd at <hi>Stockholm</hi> with an inward Fever, that waſted him by degrees; yet he continu'd ſtill to manage Affairs with his uſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and reſolv'd to Reign to the laſt moment of his Life. Some hours before his Death he ſent for <hi>Eric Steno</hi> the Secretary of State, to whom he dictated Memoris concerning the moſt ſecret Affairs of the Kingdom. Then he ſent for the young Princes, and charg'd 'em to love one another, and ſubmit peaceably to Prince <hi>Eric,</hi> who was now ready to mount the Throne. He gave each of 'em his Bleſſing, and made 'em preſently withdraw, leſt his Mind ſhou'd be diſturb'd by the Tears of his Family. He diſmiſt even his Phyſicians, (who in that Extremity continu'd ſtill to flatter him with hopes of Life,) that he might ſpend the laſt moments of his Life in fixing his Thoughts wholly upon God. Thus he died peaceably in the Arms of his Servants,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1560"/> in the 70th Year of his Age. His Body was carried to <hi>

                  <note place="margin">Sept. 29.</note> where his Funeral was ſolemniz'd with publick Orations and Panegyricks, with the Tears of all his Subjects, and the immortal Memory of his glorious Actions.</p>
               <p>He ow'd his Crown meerly to his own Valor, and Reign'd with as abſolute a Power as if the Crown had been his Birth-right. He made what Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he pleas'd in Religion, the Laws, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of his Subjects, and yet dy'd ador'd by the People, and admir'd by the Nobility. He left his Kingdom in Peace with all his Neighbors, ſecur'd by a League with <hi>France,</hi> and enrich'd by a fiouriſhing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62547:154"/>Trade with all the Nations of <hi>Europe;</hi> the Revenues of the Crown were much augmented, his Treaſury full, his Arſenals well furniſh'd; there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Fleet in the Ports, the Frontier-places were fortify'd, and, in a word, <hi>Sweden</hi> was in a condition to ſtrike her Enemies with Terror, and inſpire her Allies with Reſpect.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>A CHRONOLOGICAL ABRIDGMENT OF THE</hi> Hiſtory of Sweden.</head>
            <p>ALL Nations have had Hiſtorians that have ſpoken of the Antiquity of their Original with ſo much Partiality and Exaggeration, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering Perſon will hardly venture to depend upon the Authority of the Authors of ancient Chronicles, and the Accounts of thoſe remote times. The leaſt Affinity of Names is reckon'd a ſufficient Ground by moſt of thoſe ancient or modern Writers, to chuſe at pleaſure among the ancient Hero's, and even among the firſt Inhabitants of the World, ſuch a Founder as they thought fit to name for their Country. Among thoſe Hiſtorians that are ſo fond of Antiquity and zealous for the Honour of their Country, thoſe who have publiſh'd an intire Body of the <hi>Hiſtory of Sweden,</hi> have, in my Opinion, out-done all the Writers of other Nations. They ſcruple not to affirm that <hi>Sweden</hi> is the ancientest Monarchy, not only of the North, but even of all <hi>Europe.</hi> According to thoſe creditious or too partial Authors, <hi>Magog, Noah</hi>'s Grandſon, came from <hi>Scythia</hi> to <hi>Finland;</hi> from whence, coaſting the Gulf of <hi>Bothnia</hi> to <hi>Gothland,</hi> he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62547:155"/>ſettl'd his Son <hi>Gethar</hi> or <hi>Gog,</hi> in that Country, who is ſaid to have been the first Prince of the <hi>Goths;</hi> and the Stock of the Royal Line. I will not undertake, in this place, to decide that famous Queſtion, whether <hi>Sweden</hi> be the original Habitation, or only a Colony of the ancient <hi>Goths.</hi> Both theſe Opinions are aſſerted by ſeveral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. But I am fully ſatisfy'd, that 'twou'd be a very difficult Task to give a clear and diſtinct Account of the firſt Inhabitants of <hi>Sweden,</hi> from whence they came, and when they ſettl'd in that Country. Nor wou'd it be leſs difficult to prove, what thoſe ancient Chroniclers ſeem to ſuppoſe, that <hi>Sweden</hi> had Kings almost as ſoon as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; for 'tis probable, that the Heads of Families were the first Princes of the Earth, and that Men did not voluntarily ſubmit to a Monarchical Government, till they were convinc'd, by a long Experience, of the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of a tumultuous Liberty.</p>
            <p>But, ſuppoſing ſome ancient Manuſcript had faithfully preſerv'd the Names of the ſeveral Lords that have Rul'd in <hi>Sweden,</hi> Who can tell whether they were Kings, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Princes of ſome particular Country, or perhaps Judges and Captains in their reſpective Juriſdictions? And 'tis even not improbable that thoſe Heads, whoſe Names are preſerv'd, were Cotemporary, and at the ſame time Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of ſeveral Provinces; and that the reaſon why Hiſtorians rank'd 'em ſucceſſively in their Writings, was, that they might have a longer ſeries of Kings, to fill up their Chronology. In the mean time 'tis certain, that there is no fixt <hi>Aera</hi> to be found in the <hi>Hiſtory of Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> till about the middle of the Twelfth Age; before which time the Relations of that Country are full of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Confuſion, Hiſtory intermixt with Fables, and embelliſh'd with fictitious Wonders, extracted from old Legends, or ancient Songs in heroick Verſe, which were the only Annals of thoſe Times.</p>
            <p>In thoſe remote Ages, all the Princes and Hero's are either Giants or famous Magicians, who ſignalize their Strength and pretended Power by robbing one another, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62547:155"/>by committing barbarous and unheard of Cruelties againſt their Enemies. Juſtice and Honeſty were unknown in thoſe Ages, and even had not ſo much as a Name among theſe barbarous Nations. All Controverſies were decided by force, the moſt violent Men were moſt reſpected, and 'twas reckon'd a diſhonor for a Prince not to raviſh a Princeſs, before he married her. A wild Beast kill'd in the ſight of the People, or an Enemy ſurpriz'd and aſſaſſinated in his Houſe, was enough to make the bold Murderer a Hero while he liv'd, and ſometimes a God after his death.</p>
            <p>I ſhall however give the Reader a Catalogue of thoſe ancient Kings, as I have collected 'em from <hi>Swediſh</hi> Authors, beginning with <hi>Eric I.</hi> who reign'd (as they relate) <hi>2000</hi> Years before our Saviour's Birth. The Chronology you will find in the Margin, according to the computation of thoſe Writers; but I ſhall aſſert nothing till I come down to nearer Ages, where the Truth begins to appear with more certainty and clearneſs.</p>
